### 2. There are **three** forms of the definite article (the) in Welsh

**2.1 – ‘y’ is used in front of a consonant. Singular, feminine nouns will undergo a Soft Mutation after ‘y’ (except those beginning with ‘ll’ and ‘rh’). See S.M. rule 1.**

* ci - y ci - the dog  
* cath - y gath - the cat  
* bachgen - y bachgen - the boy  
* merch - y ferch - the girl  
        
**2.2 – ‘yr’ is used in front of a vowel and in front of h. Remember that ‘w’ and ‘y’ are vowels in Welsh.**

##### Examples:

* e.g. ysgol - yr ysgol - the school  
* enw - yr enw - the name  
* afal - yr afal - the apple  
* het - yr het - the hat  

**2.3 – ‘r’ is used after a word ending in a vowel - no matter whether the word which follows begins with a vowel or with a consonant.**

##### Examples:

* e.g. Mae’r plant - The children are  
* Mae’r ysgol - The school is  
* Dyma‘r llyfr - Here’s the book  
* Dacw‘r afon - There’s the river
