7. ‘yn’ (in) causes a Nasal Mutation. See N.M. rule 1.
e.g. Dolgellau - yn N olgellau tŷ Bob - yn nhŷ Bob
‘yn’ changes to ‘ym’ if the word which follows it begins with an m
e.g. Bangor - ym Mangor parc y dref - ym mharc y dref
‘yn’ changes to ‘yng’ if the word which follows it begins with ng
e.g. Gardd Eden - yng Ngardd Eden Cymru - yng Nghymru
8. Don’t confuse ‘mewn’ (in a) with ‘yn’ (in) or ‘yn y’ (in the).
e.g. mewn tŷ - in a house yn y tŷ - in the house
mewn car - in a car yn y car - in the car
9. We all know that it is considered grammatically incorrect to end a sentence
with a preposition in English (but we often hear such sentences in the spoken
language).
e.g. This is the house I live in. (…in which I live)
Whom are you talking about? (About whom are you talking?)
This rule does not apply in Welsh - so long as the ‘personal’ form of the
preposition is used.
e.g. Dyma’r tŷ dw i’n byw ynddo.
- This is the house I live in.
 (refers to ‘tŷ’ which is masculine )
Pwy ydy’r plant rydyn ni’n gwrando arnyn?
- Who are the children we’re listening to?
(refers to ‘plant’ which is plural)
Pwy oedd y ferch roedden nhw’n edrych amdani?
- Who was the girl they were looking for?
(refers to ‘merch’ which is feminine )
