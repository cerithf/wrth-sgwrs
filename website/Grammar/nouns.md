1. All nouns in Welsh are either masculine or feminine. There is no neuter gender. Unfortunately there is no way of telling which nouns are feminine and which are masculine, so it is important to learn the gender at the same time as the meaning. In a dictionary ‘b’ (benywaidd) will denote feminine nouns and ‘g’ (gwrywaidd) will denote masculine nouns.

2. Singular, feminine nouns undergo a Soft Mutation after the definite article ‘y’ (the) (except those words which begin with ‘ll’ and ‘rh’). See S.M. rule 1.
    * e.g. tref - y dref - the town
    * cadair - y gadair - the chair
    * merch - y ferch - the girl
    * llaw - y llaw - the hand
    * rhaw - y rhaw - the spade

3. We always use singular nouns after numbers in Welsh. Although the plural of ‘car’ is ‘ceir’ note the use of the singular form after numbers.
    * e.g. one car - un car
    * ten cars - deg car
    * eight cars - wyth car
    * two cars - dau gar
    
4. Feminine nouns undergo a Soft Mutation after the numbers ‘un’ (one) (except those words which begin with ‘ll’ and ‘rh’) and ‘dwy’ (two). See S.M. rules 2 and 3. Notice that the form ‘dwy’ is used with feminine nouns only.
    * e.g. un ferch - one girl / dwy ferch - two girls
    * un llaw - one hand / dwy law - two hands
    * un bont - one bridge / dwy bont - two bridge

5. Masculine nouns undergo a Soft Mutation after the number ‘dau’ (two). See S.M. rule 4. Notice that the form ‘dau’ is used with masculine nouns only.
    * e.g. dau fachgen - two boys
    * dau gi - two dogs
    * dau ddyn - two men
    * dau blentyn - two children

6. Masculine nouns after ‘tri’ (three) and all singular nouns after ‘chwe’ (six) undergo an Aspirate Mutation. See A.M. rules 1 and 2. The form ‘tri’ is used
with masculine nouns only.
    * e.g. tri cheffyl - three horses
    * tri phlentyn - three children
    * tri thractor - three tractors
    * chwe cheiniog - six pennies (pence)
    * chwe phunt - six pounds
    * chwe thegan - six toys

7. Nouns will undergo a Soft Mutation after the linking ‘yn’.
See S.M. rule 12.
    * e.g. Roedd Mair yn ddoctor. - Mair was a doctor.
    * Mae e’n filiwnydd. (S.W.) - He’s a millionaire.
    * Dydy o ddim yn brifathro.- He isn’t a headmaster. (N.W.)
