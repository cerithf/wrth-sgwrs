## 8. Conjunctions

### 1. 'A' ('and')

‘A’ (and) is used in front of a consonant and ‘ac’ in front of a vowel. Remember that ‘w’ and ‘y’ are vowels in Welsh.

For example:

- bachgen a merch – a boy and a girl
- car a bws – a car and a bus
- tŷ ac ysgol – a house and a school
- oren ac afal – an orange and an apple

‘A’ causes an Aspirate Mutation in words beginning with c, p and t. See A.M. rule 3.

For example:

- ci a chath – a dog and a cat
- papur a phensil – paper and a pencil
- coffi a the – coffee and tea
- mam a thad – a mother and (a) father

Remember that y becomes 'r after a vowel, meaning that 'a y' becomes a'r (not ac y).

For example:

| Incorrect ❌    | Correct ✅     | English                    |

| y ci a y gath   | y ci a’r gath  | the dog and the cat        |
| y tŷ a yr ysgol | y tŷ a’r ysgol | the house and the school " |

### 2. ‘Neu’ ('or')

'Neu' ('or') causes a Soft Mutation. See S.M. rule 14.

For example:

- ci neu gath – a dog or a cat
- te neu goffi – tea or coffee
- bachgen neu ferch – a boy or a girl
- coffi neu de – coffee or tea
