## 3. Articles (The/An)

In English, there are two kinds of article: the **definite** article (the word "the") and the **indefinite** article (the word "a" or "an").

In Welsh, there are 3 forms of the definite article: y, yr and 'r.

- **Y** is the most common word for "the". It is used between consonants.
- **Yr** is used after a consonant and before a vowel.
- **'r** is always used after a vowel.

-> Singular, feminine nouns undergo a soft mutation after y/yr/'r (see _Mutations_)

Welsh has no indefinite article, you simply say the noun by itself without a word for "a"/"an" in front of it.
