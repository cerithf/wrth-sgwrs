The term 'Cymro Cymraeg', 'Cymraes Gymraeg' and 'Cymry Cymraeg' are terms that refer to Welsh-speaking Welsh people. 'Di-gymraeg' is the corresponding term meaning 'non-Welsh-speaking'.

For example:

Also note 'adnabod' means 'to recognise', or 'to be familiar with'.

### 5. 'Sut' vs. 'Pa mor'

Note the difference between the following:

- Sut? - How? (followed by a verb)

- Mae’r llyfr wedi mynd yn ôl i’r llyfrgell. - The book has gone back to the library.

Both sound (almost) the same when spoken, and increasingly 'nôl' is used to mean 'back' as well' in spoken Welsh:

- Mae hi wedi symud nôl i Gymru – She's moved back to Wales.

### 7. Words for 'to spend'

Note the difference between the following:

- gwario - to spend money
- treulio - to spend time

For example:

Note that 'treulio' also means 'to digest'.

### 8. 'Bod'

‘Bod’ is used to convey ‘that... is/was’ or ‘that... are/were’.

For example:

- Dw i’n gwybod bod John ar ei wyliau. - I know that John is on holiday.
- Roedden nhw’n meddwl bod y plant yn chwarae y parc. - They thought that the children were playing in the park.

‘Bod’ has ‘personal’ forms:

| Welsh          | English            |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| (fy) mod i     | that I am/was      |
| (dy) fod ti    | that you are/were  |
| (ei )fod o/e   | that he is/was     |
| (ei) bod hi    | that she is/was    |
| (ein) bod ni   | that we are/were   |
| (eich) bod chi | that you are/were  |
| (eu) bod nhw   | that they are/were |

In ordinary conversation the first pronoun is often omitted:

- Dw i’n meddwl (fy) mod i’n mynd i Lundain yfory. - I think that I’m going to London tomorrow.
- Fe ddwedon nhw (eu) bod nhw’n rhydd. - They said that they were free.
- Dw i’n siŵr (ei) bod hi wedi mynd adre. - I’m sure that she has gone home.

The ‘bod’ pattern is also used after the following words:

- achos (because)
- hwyrach / falle (perhaps)
- er (even though)
- gobeithio (hopefully)

For example:

- Mae Mair yn y gwely achos (ei) bod hi’n sâl. - Mair’s in bed because she is ill.
- Gobeithio (eu) bod nhw wedi ennill. - Hopefully (I hope that) they have won.

### 9. Emphatic sentence after 'that'

When an emphatic sentence is used after ‘that’ - i.e. the sentence begins with a noun or a phrase of some kind, not a verb - then the Welsh word for ’that’ is:

- mai - N.W.
- taw - S.W.

- Mae Tom yn dweud mai/taw yn Nolgellau mae Mair yn byw. - Tom says that it is in Dolgellau that Mair lives.
