### Introduction

Numbers are a little more complicated in Welsh than in English. The main things to know are:

- The numbers 2, 3 and 4 have masculine (m) and feminine (f) forms
- Nouns following numbers are _always_ in singular, even when talking about multiple things (i.e. instead of saying "dwy gadeiriau" for "two chairs", you would say "dwy gadair", so literally "two chair"). The plural can be used if "o" (of) is placed between the number and the noun, which is more common with larger number ("pedwar deg o gadeiriau" = "forty [of] chairs").
- There are two systems for the numbers 11–99: the older, more complex system, and the newwer, simpler system
- Some numbers cause grammatical mutations
- Some numbers (like 5 and 6) have a different form when used in front of a noun

(See below for more information on the above points.)

The numbers 1–10 are as follows:

| Number | Welsh                   | Number | Welsh  |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1      | un                      | 6      | chwech |
| 2      | dau (m) / dwy (f)       | 7      | saith  |
| 3      | tri (m) / tair (f)      | 8      | wyth   |
| 4      | pedwar (m) / pedair (f) | 9      | naw    |
| 5      | pump                    | 10     | deg    |

### Masculine & Feminine Forms of 2, 3 and 4

The numbers 2, 3 and 4 have different forms depending on whether they are used with a masculine or feminine noun. The masculine forms are the default when using numbers in an abstract way when not referring to any noun.

| Number | Masculine Noun | English Meaning        | Feminine Noun   | English Meaning      |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| 2      | Dau fachgen    | Two boys               | Dwy ferch       | Two girls            |
| 3      | Tri bwrdd      | Three tables           | Tair cadair     | Three chairs         |
| 4      | Pedwar athro   | Four (male) teachers\* | Pedair athrawes | Four female teachers |

\* Note that "Pedwar athro" could refer to four male teachers or a group of four teachers with at least one male member. "Pedair athrawes" on the other hand only refers to four female teachers.

Also note that every Welsh noun in the above table is in singular even though English uses the plural forms, in Welsh the number is enough to tell the listener that there is more than one of the noun specified. The Welsh plural forms are only used when no number is specified, and can be seen here:

| Singular                  | Plural                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Bachgen (boy)\*           | Bechgyn (boys)               |
| Merch (girl)\*            | Merched (girls)              |
| Bwrdd (table)             | Byrddau (tables)             |
| Cadair (chair)            | Cadeiriau (chairs)           |
| Athro ((male) teacher)    | Athrawon (teachers)          |
| Athrawes (female teacher) | Athrawesau (female teachers) |

\* Note that these terms are standard in South Wales, in North Wales it is more likely you'll hear hogyn/hogiau for boy(s) and hogan/gennod for girl(s).

### Numbers 11–99

#### The Newer System (Decimal)

The newer system is the simpler of the two, and is used for most arithmetic and any situations where clarity is important. The new system involves simply naming the first digit, saying the word "deg" (ten), and then naming the second digit. That means once you have learnt the numbers 1–10, there is nothing more to learn until you get to 99.

| Number | Welsh (newer system) | Number | Welsh (newer system) |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| 11     | un deg un            | 21     | dau ddeg un          |
| 12     | un deg dau           | 34     | tri deg pedwar       |
| 13     | un deg tri           | 48     | pedwar deg wyth      |
| 14     | un deg pedwar        | 52     | pump deg dau         |
| 15     | un deg pump          | 63     | chwech deg tri       |
| 16     | un deg chwech        | 77     | saith deg saith      |
| 17     | un deg saith         | 89     | wyth deg naw         |
| 18     | un deg wyth          | 95     | naw deg pump         |
| 19     | un deg naw           |        |                      |
| 20     | dauddeg\*            |        |                      |

\* 20 is "dauddeg" rather than "daudeg" because "dau" causes a soft mutation (see below)

Note that the masculine forms of 2, 3 and 4 are always used in this system, regardless of the noun (e.g. "un deg dau merch" = "twelve girls")

#### The Older System (Vigesimal)

The older system is more complicated, and is generally reserved for dates and time or for more poetic or formal writing. It is more commonly used for smaller numbers.

This system is based on groups of twenty (vigesimal) rather than ten (decimal), and the ones digit comes before that of the tens (think "four and twenty blackbirds" rather than "twenty-four blackbirds").

Things to look out for:

- Some numbers are exceptions that break the pattern.
- When dealing with nouns, the noun is placed in the "middle" of the number rather than coming after it ("four blackbirds on twenty").
- There is differentiation for the masculine and feminine forms of 2, 3 and 4 every time they appear

The numbers 11-20 are:

| Number | Welsh (older system)               |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 11     | un ar ddeg                         |
| 12     | deuddeg                            |
| 13     | tri (m) / tair (f) ar ddeg         |
| 14     | pedwar (m)/ pedair (f) ar ddeg     |
| 15     | pymtheg                            |
| 16     | un ar bymtheg                      |
| 17     | dau (m) / dwy (f) ar bymtheg       |
| 18     | deunaw\*                           |
| 19     | pedwar (m) / pedair (f) ar bymtheg |
| 20     | ugain                              |

\* Literally "two nines"

Note how counting starts again at 15 (pymtheg) and the exceptions of 12 and 18.

Because this is a vigesimal system, counting starts again after 20. A multiple of 20 must be added to the number to keep going:

| Numeral | Number by itself | Number as an ending |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| 20      | ugain            | ar hugain           |
| 40      | deugain          | a deugain           |
| 60      | trigain          | a thrigain          |
| 80      | pedwar ugain     | a phedwar ugain     |

Some examples:

| Number | Welsh (older system)         | Number | Welsh (older system)                     |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 21     | un ar hugain                 | 42     | dau/dwy a deugain                        |
| 22     | dau/dwy ar hugain            | 50     | deg a deugain                            |
| 25     | pump ar hugain               | 55     | pymtheg a deugain                        |
| 29     | naw ar hugain                | 56     | un ar bymtheg a deugain                  |
| 30     | deg ar hugain                | 58     | deunaw a deugain                         |
| 31     | un ar ddeg ar hugain         | 63     | tri/tair a thrigain                      |
| 33     | tri/tair ar ddeg ar hugain   | 72     | deuddeg a thrigain                       |
| 35     | pymtheg ar hugain            | 74     | pedwar/pedair ar ddeg a thrigain         |
| 37     | dau/dwy ar bymtheg ar hugain | 85     | pump a phedwar ugain                     |
| 38     | deunaw ar hugain             | 99     | pedwar/pedair ar bymtheg a phedwar ugain |

As stated above, when using nouns with a number in the older system, the noun is placed in the "middle" of the number:

| English            | Welsh (older system)     | Welsh (newer system) |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| thirteen miles     | tair (f) milltir ar ddeg | un deg tri milltir   |
| fourteen tables    | pedwar (m) bwrdd ar ddeg | un deg pedwar bwrdd  |
| fifty-eight floors | deunaw llawr a deugain   | pump deg wyth llawr  |

Some of these numbers get quite long and complicated, and so it's also possible to:

- Use "hanner" (half). Often used as "hanner cant" (half of a hundred) to mean 50
- The word "namyn" (≈ "minus") is used when a number is a little less than a round one

Some examples:

| Number | Welsh (older system)   |
| ------ | ---------------------- |
| 51     | hanner cant ac un      |
| 45     | hanner cant namyn pump |
| 60     | hanner cant a deg      |
| 99     | cant namyn un          |

Using numbers like this is usually accompanied with the "o + plural" construction, and can be utilised to place the noun after the entire number in general.

| English            | Welsh (older system)                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| thirteen miles     | tair ar ddeg o filltiroedd                                 |
| fourteen tables    | pedwar ar ddeg o fyrddau / pymtheg namyn un o fyrddau      |
| fifty-eight floors | deunaw a deugain o loriau / hanner cant ac wyth o loriau   |
| fifty-one items    | hanner cant ac un o eitemau                                |
| forty-five places  | deugain a phump o lefydd / hanner cant namyn pump o lefydd |
| sixty cars         | trigain o geir / hanner cant a deg o geir                  |
| ninety-nine cats   | cant namyn un o gathod                                     |

### Larger Numbers

Either of the two systems can be used when dealing with numbers past 100, though the newer system is much more common. Note that words for numbers are nouns and have grammatical gender, which is reflected in how the numbers are said and written:

| Number        | Welsh      |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| 100           | cant (m)   |
| 1,000         | mil (f)    |
| 10,000        | deg mil    |
| 100,000       | can mil    |
| 1,000,000     | miliwn (m) |
| 1,000,000,000 | biliwn (m) |

As "mil" is feminine, the feminine forms of 2, 3 or 4 are used in front of it.

| Number   | Welsh                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 101      | cant ac un                          |
| 200      | dau gant                            |
| 245      | dau gant a phedwar deg pump         |
| 300      | tri chant                           |
| 2025     | dwy fil a dau ddeg pump             |
| 3,300    | tair mil a thri chant               |
| 4,450    | pedair mil, pedwar cant a phump deg |
| £100,000 | can mil o bunnoedd                  |

### Mutations and Other Forms

A soft mutation occurs:

- After "dau" or "dwy"
- After "un" if the noun is feminine and doesn't start with "ll" or "rh"

Examples:

- un **g**ath (f), un ci (m) - one cat, one dog
- dwy **f**raich (f), dau **f**alconi (m) – two arms, two balconies
- un **b**unt (f), un person (m) – one pound, one person
- un llwy (f), dau **l**wybr (m) – one spoon, one path

---

The numbers ‘pump’ (five), ‘chwech’ (six) and ‘cant’ (hundred) drop the final consonant when they stand immediately in front of a noun.

- pum potel - five bottles
- chwe llwy - six spoons
- can punt - hundred pounds

---

Both "tri" and "chwe" cause aspirate mutations:

- tri pherson - three people/persons
- chwe phunt - six pounds
- BUT tair punt - three pounds

---

"Deg", "deuddeg", and "pymtheg" add an extra "n" when dealing with time.

Before "mis" (month(s)), "mlynedd" (year(s)) and "munud" (minute(s)), the numbers "deg" (10), "deuddeg" (12) and "pymtheg" (15) become "deng", "deuddeng" and "pymtheng" respectively:

- deng mlynedd - ten years
- deuddeng munud - twelve minutes
- pymtheng mis - fifteen months

---

‘Blynedd’ (year(s)) undergoes a nasal mutation to become ‘mlynedd’ after many numbers:

|                         |                     |                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| 5 - pum mlynedd         | 7 - saith mlynedd   | 8 - wyth mlynedd      |
| 9 - naw mlynedd         | 10 - deng mlynedd   | 12 - deuddeng mlynedd |
| 15 - pymtheng mlynedd   | 18 - deunaw mlynedd | 20 - ugain mlynedd    |
| 50 - hanner can mlynedd | 100 - can mlynedd   |                       |

---

When giving someone’s age, whether male or female, remember to use the feminine forms ’dwy’ (two), ‘tair’ (three) and ‘pedair’ (four) which refer to the number of years, which is a feminine noun in Welsh. The word "mlwydd" (another form of blynedd, meaning "years") can be used, or omitted.

- Mae hi’n ddwy (mlwydd) oed. - She’s two years old / of age.
- Roedd Gwyn yn bedair (mlwydd) oed ddoe. - Gwyn was four years old / of age yesterday.
