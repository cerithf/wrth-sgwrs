## 10. Mutations

Mutations, officially "initial consonant mutations" or "grammatical mutations", are a process that happens in Welsh when the original first letter of a word gets changed due to the grammar. Welsh has 3 kinds of mutations: the soft mutation (treiglad meddal), the nasal mutation (treiglad trwynol) and the aspirate mutation (treiglad llaes). There are nine letters that can undergo mutations: three that can undergo all three mutations, three that can undergo two of them, and three that can only undergo the soft mutation. In the table below, you can see those nine letters in the "original letter" column, and the letters they mutate into in each mutation.

| Original Letter | Soft Mutation | Nasal Mutation | Aspirate Mutation |
| --------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| p               | b             | mh             | ph                |
| t               | d             | nh             | th                |
| c               | g             | ngh            | ch                |
| b               | f             | m              |                   |
| d               | dd            | n              |                   |
| g               | -\*           | ng             |                   |
| ll              | l             |                |                   |
| m               | f             |                |                   |
| rh              | r             |                |                   |

\* This denotes that the letter "g" is removed when the word goes through a soft mutation (i.e. gafr -> afr)

When a word goes through a mutation, both the spelling and pronunciation change to reflect it. Because of this, the same word can potentially be written 4 ways depending on which mutation it has undergone, if any at all (for example, the Welsh word for "castle" is "castell", which can also appear as "gastell" (soft mutation), "nghastell" (nasal mutation), or "chastell" (aspirate mutation)).

The table above may seem daunting, but there are patterns to look out for. The aspirate mutation simply means adding an "h" to the letter and changing the pronunciation accordingly. The nasal mutations for p, t and c are the same as for b, d and g but with an added "h". The soft mutation generally means "voicing" (or, indeed, "softening") the letter.

There is also a concept called "the invasive H" which is related to mutations but does not technically fall under the same category. This involves adding an initial "H" to words that begin with vowels under certain conditions (such as after "ei" meaning "her", "ein" or "eu"). See "Pronouns (Rhagenwau)" for more details.
