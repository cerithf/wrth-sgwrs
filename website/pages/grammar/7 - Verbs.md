## D. Berfau - Verbs

In Welsh, there are two kinds of tenses: long-form and short-form.

**Long-form** tenses are formed by conjugating the verb "to be", followed by the linking word "yn" or "wedi" (or both), and sometimes another verb-noun (unconjugated verb/infinitive).

**Short-form** tenses are formed by conjugating the verb directly. This is done by attaching different endings onto the verb stem depending on person and tense.

The tenses in each category are:

| Long-form tenses        | Short-form tenses        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1. The Present Tense    | 6. The Past Tense        |
| 2. The Imperfect Tense  | 7. The Future Tense      |
| 3. The Perfect Tense    | 8. The Conditional Tense |
| 4. The Pluperfect Tense | 9. The Imperative Mood   |

| 5. The Future Continuous Tense

### 1. The Present Tense

All verb-nouns are added to various persons of the verb ‘to be’ - linked by ‘yn’. There is no mutation after this linking ‘yn’. After a vowel, 'yn' becomes 'n

#### (a) The Affirmative forms

For clarity, the English translations below use the forms for "to be" (am/are/is), but these can also translate to do/does, too.

| Standard froms    | Spoken forms    | English          |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Rydw i'n          | Dw i'n, Dwi'n   | I am             |
| Rwyt ti'n         | "               | You are          |
| Mae e'n/o'n       | "               | He / It (m) is   |
| Mae hi'n          | "               | She / It (f) is  |
| Rydyn ni'n        | Dyn/Dan ni'n    | We are           |
| Rydych chi'n      | Dych/Dach chi'n | You are          |
| Maen nhw'n        | "               | They are         |
| Mae Tom/Bethan yn | "               | Tom/Bethan is    |
| Mae'r car yn      | "               | The car is       |
| Mae'r plant yn    | "               | The children are |

Notes:

- Ditto marks (") indicate when the spoken form matches the standard form
- "E" is used as he/him in South Wales, and "o" in North Wales. They appear as "e'n"/"o'n" in the table
- As Welsh nouns are gendered, "e"/"o" are used as "it" for masculine nouns, and "hi" for feminine ones. (In practice, the choice of pronoun does not always match up with the "correct" gender of the noun.)
- There are different verb forms for each pronoun, and all nouns use the singular third person form (he/she/it), regardless of whether the noun is singular or plural. This differs from English, where the verb changes to reflect whether a noun is singular or plural (e.g. "The child plays" -> "the children play", but "Mae'r plentyn yn chwarae" -> "Mae'r plant yn chwarae")

In Welsh, the present tense is used for both continuous and general statements: "Dwi'n byw yn Llandudno" can be translated as:

- I live in Llandudno
- I'm living in Llandudno
- I do live Llandudno

#### (b) The Negative forms

| Welsh                  | English                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Dydw i ddim            | I’m not / don’t               |
| Dwyt ti ddim           | You’re (familiar) not / don’t |
| Dydych chi ddim        | You’re (polite) not / don’t   |
| Dydy Tom / Bethan ddim | Tom / Bethan isn’t / doesn’t  |
| Dydy’r car ddim        | The car isn’t / doesn’t       |
| Dydy e/o ddim          | He / It (m) isn’t / doesn’t   |
| Dydy hi ddim           | She / It (f) isn’t / doesn’t  |
| Dydyn ni ddim          | We aren’t / don’t             |
| Dydych chi ddim        | You aren’t / don’t            |
| Dydy’r plant ddim      | The children aren’t / don’t   |
| Dydyn nhw ddim         | They aren’t / don’t           |

In spoken language, the first "dy-" often gets dropped (Dydw i ddim -> Dw i ddim). This means that the negative form can sometimes match the affirmative form when speaking, and the word "ddim" alone shows the negation (like "not" in English) although officially speaking they are separate. In some dialects, particularly in North Wales, "ddim" is shortened to 'm (Dw i'm).

In negative sentences the "yn" follows "ddim":

- Dach chi ddim yn gweithio'n galed – You aren't working hard / You don't work hard

#### (c) The Question forms and the ’No / Yes’ replies

In standard Welsh, yes/no questions are answered by repeating the verb in the affirmative rather than saying "yes" or "no" – an example of this in English would be: "Are you coming today?" – "I am". In informal spoken Welsh, "ie" and "na" can be used to say yes or no respectively.

The table below shows questions and their appropriate response forms in standard Welsh, along with their English translations:

| Welsh (Question) | English (Question)          | Welsh (Response) | English (Response)      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Ydw i?           | Am/Do I?                    | (Nac) Ydw        | I am (not)/do(n't)      |
| Wyt ti?          | Are/Do you? (familiar)      | (Nac) wyt        | You are(n't)/do(n't)    |
| Ydy e/o?         | Is/Does he/it (m)?          | (Nac) Ydy        | He is(n't)/does(n't)    |
| Ydy hi?          | Is/Does she/it (f)?         | (Nac) Ydy        | She is(n't)/does(n't)   |
| Ydyn ni?         | Are/Do we?                  | (Nac) Ydyn       | We are(n't)/do(n't)     |
| Ydych chi ?      | Are/Do you? (polite/plural) | (Nac) Ydych      | You are(n't)/do(n't)    |
| Ydyn nhw?        | Are/Do they?                | (Nac) Ydyn       | They are(n't)/do(n't)   |
| Ydy Tom/Bethan?  | Is/Does Tom/Bethan?         | (Nac) Ydy        | (S)he is(n't)/does(n't) |
| Ydy’r car?       | Is the car?                 | (Nac) Ydy        | It is(n't)/does(n't)    |
| Ydy’r plant?\*   | Are/Do the children?        | (Nac) Ydyn       | They are(n't)/do(n't)   |

"Nac" is used here for negation (like "not" in English).

\* Notice that the singular form of the verb (ydy) is used with the noun, even if the noun is plural. The response uses the plural form, "ydyn", because it implies the pronoun "nhw" (they).

##### Indefinite questions & replies

Indefinite questions are ones which ask "Is/Are there...?". These differ slightly in that a different form is used to answer these questions compared with declarative statements. See below:

|                                      | Welsh          | English                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Declarative statement (positive)** | Mae (yna)      | There is/are...                             |
| **Declarative statement (negative)** | Does dim       | There isn't/aren't...                       |
| **Question**                         | Oes (yna)?     | Is/Are there?...                            |
| **Response to a question**           | Oes // Nac oes | Yes, there is/are // No, there isn't/aren't |

Notice how the question & response use "oes", positive statements use "mae" and negative statements use "does dim". Like with other question forms, however, the reply is formed using the verb at the start of the question: ("Oes tŷ bach yn yr adeilad?" "Oes." – "Is there a toilet in the building?" "There is.")

The use of "yna", often shortened to 'na, after "mae" or "oes" in these sentences is optional, and causes a soft mutation:

- Oes car yn y garej? / Oes 'na **g**ar yn y garej? -> Oes
- Is there a car in the garage? -> There is.

Some example questions and answers. Remember, the use of 'na is optional:

|                          | Welsh                                    | English                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Positive statemement** | Mae ci yn eistedd wrth y drws            | There is a dog sitting by the door        |
| **Negative statemement** | Does dim ci yn eistedd wrth y drws       | There isn't a dog sitting by the door     |
| **Question**             | Oes ci yn eistedd wrth y drws?           | Is there a dog sitting by the door?       |
| **Answer**               | Oes.                                     | Yes, there is.                            |
| **Positive statemement** | Mae 'na blant yn chwarae yn y parc       | There are children playing in the park    |
| **Negative statemement** | Does 'na ddim plant yn chwarae yn y parc | There aren't children playing in the park |
| **Question**             | Oes 'na blant yn chwarae yn y park?      | Are there children playing in the park?   |
| **Answer**               | Nac oes.                                 | No, there aren't.                         |

### 2. The Imperfect (was / were / used to) Tense

As in the Present Tense, all verb-nouns are added to various persons of the Imperfect Tense of the verb ‘to be’ - linked again by ‘yn’. There is no mutation after this linking ‘yn’.

#### (a) The Affirmative forms

| Standard froms      | Spoken forms | English           |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Roeddwn i'n         | Ro'n i'n     | I was             |
| Roeddet ti'n        | Ro't ti'n    | You were          |
| Roedd e'n/o'n       | "            | He / It (m) was   |
| Roedd hi'n          | "            | She / It (f) was  |
| Roedden ni'n        | Ro'n ni'n    | We were           |
| Roeddech chi'n      | Ro'ch chi'n  | You were          |
| Roedden nhw'n       | Ro'n nhw'n   | They were         |
| Roedd Tom/Bethan yn | "            | Tom/Bethan was    |
| Roedd y car yn      | "            | The car was       |
| Roedd\* y plant yn  | "            | The children were |

\* Again, the singular third-person form is used with all nouns, regardless of if they are plural (**Roedd** y car, **Roedd** y plant vs. The car **was**, the children **were**)

Unlike the present tense, which can have multiple translations, the imperfect tense always uses the gerund in English:

- Roeddwn i'n byw yn Llandudno – I was living in Llandudno (NOT: I lived in Llandudno)
- Roeddech chi'n gweithio'n galed – You were working hard (NOT: You worked hard)
- Roedd hi'n siopa yn Llundain – She was shopping in London (NOT: She shopped in London)

#### (b) The Negative forms

| Standard froms            | Spoken forms      | English           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Doeddwn i ddim yn         | Do'n i ddim yn    | I was             |
| Doeddet ti ddim yn        | Do't ti ddim yn   | You were          |
| Doedd e ddim yn/o ddim yn | "                 | He / It (m) was   |
| Doedd hi ddim yn          | "                 | She / It (f) was  |
| Doedden ni ddim yn        | Do'n ni ddim yn   | We were           |
| Doeddech chi ddim yn      | Do'ch chi ddim yn | You were          |
| Doedden nhw ddim yn       | Do'n nhw ddim yn  | They were         |
| Doedd Tom/Bethan ddim yn  | "                 | Tom/Bethan was    |
| Doedd y car ddim yn       | "                 | The car was       |
| Doedd\* y plant ddim yn   | "                 | The children were |

\* Again, the singular form "doedd" is used with all nouns, including plurals.

#### (c) The Question forms and the ’No / Yes’ replies

| Welsh (Question) | English (Question)        | Welsh (Response) | English (Response) |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Oeddwn i?        | Was I?                    | (Nac) oeddwn     | I was(n't)         |
| Oeddet ti?       | Were you? (familiar)      | (Nac) oeddet     | You were(n't)      |
| Oedd e/o?        | Was he/it (m)?            | (Nac) oedd       | He was(n't)        |
| Oedd hi?         | Was she/it (f)?           | (Nac) oedd       | She was(n't)       |
| Oedden ni?       | Were we?                  | (Nac) oedden     | We were(n't)       |
| Oeddech chi ?    | Were you? (polite/plural) | (Nac) oeddech    | You were(n't)      |
| Oedden nhw?      | Were they?                | (Nac) oedden     | They were(n't)     |
| Oedd Tom/Bethan? | Was Tom/Bethan?           | (Nac) oedd       | (S)he was(n't)     |
| Oedd y car?      | Was the car?              | (Nac) oedd       | It was(n't)        |
| Oedd y plant?\*  | Were/Do the children?     | (Nac) oedden     | They were(n't)     |

The spoken forms for both questions and responses are often abbreviated as we’ve seen in (a) and (b) above:

- Oeddwn -> O’n
- Oeddet -> O’t
- Oedden -> O'n
- Oeddech -> O'ch

#### (d) Indefinite forms

Unlike the present tense where definite and indefinite forms are distinguished by the use of ‘ydy’ and ‘oes’ respectively, no different form is required in the imperfect tense:

|                        |                | Welsh                      | English                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Positive statement** | **Definite**   | Roedd hi'n braf            | It was fine (weather)                    |
| **"**                  | **Indefinite** | Roedd 'na broblem          | There was a problem                      |
| **Negative statement** | **Definite**   | Doedd yr ateb ddim yn iawn | The answer wasn't right                  |
| **"**                  | **Indefinite** | Doedd dim ateb             | There was no answer                      |
| **Question**           | **Definite**   | Oedd John yno?             | Was John there?                          |
| **"**                  | **Inefinite**  | Oedd llawer yno?           | Were there many there?                   |
| **Response**           | **--**         | Oedd // Nac oedd           | Yes, it/there was // No, it/there wasn't |

### 3. The Perfect (‘wedi’) Tense

The perfect tense is formed like the present tense, except the linking word "yn" is replaced with "wedi" (they shouldn't be used together). "Wedi" is often shortened to 'di in spoken language.

#### (a) The Affirmative forms

| Standard froms      | Spoken forms       | Englhash          |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Rydw i wedi         | Dw i 'di, Dwi 'di  | I have            |
| Rwyt ti wedi        | Rwyt ti 'di        | You have          |
| Mae e/o wedi        | Mae e/o 'di        | He / It (m) has   |
| Mae hi wedi         | Mae hi 'di         | She / It (f) has  |
| Rydyn ni wedi       | Dyn/Dan ni 'di     | We have           |
| Rydych chi wedi     | Dych/Dach chi 'di  | You have          |
| Maen nhw wedi       | Maen nhw 'di       | They have         |
| Mae Tom/Bethan wedi | Mae Tom/Bethan 'di | Tom/Bethan has    |
| Mae'r car wedi      | Mae'r car 'di      | The car has       |
| Mae'r plant wedi    | Mae'r plant 'di    | The children have |

Examples:

- Dw i wedi byw yn Llandudno. - I have lived in Llandudno.
- Dych chi 'di gweithio’n galed.- You have worked hard.
- Mae hi wedi siopa yn Llundain. - She has shopped in London.

#### (b) The Negative forms

These work as above, using the present tense form with "wedi" instead of "yn". Additionally, "ddim wedi" can be replaced with the word "heb" (which means "without"), which causes a soft mutation.

Examples:

- Dw i heb orffen fy ngwaith – I haven't finished my work
- Dydy hi ddim wedi galw – She hasn't called
- Dydy'r car ddim yn fawr iawn – The car isn't very big

#### (c) The Question forms and the ’No / Yes’ replies (S.W.)

The question forms match the present tense, again incorporating "wedi".

| Welsh (Question)     | English (Question)        | Welsh (Response) | English (Response) |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Ydw i wedi?          | Have I?                   | (Nac) Ydw        | I have(n't)        |
| Wyt ti wedi?         | Have you? (familiar)      | (Nac) wyt        | You have(n't)      |
| Ydy e/o wedi?        | Has he/it (m)?            | (Nac) Ydy        | He has(n't)        |
| Ydy hi wedi?         | Has she/it (f)?           | (Nac) Ydy        | She has(n't)       |
| Ydyn ni wedi?        | Have we?                  | (Nac) Ydyn       | We have(n't)       |
| Ydych chi wedi?      | Have you? (polite/plural) | (Nac) Ydych      | You have(n't)      |
| Ydyn nhw wedi?       | Have they?                | (Nac) Ydyn       | They have(n't)     |
| Ydy Tom/Bethan wedi? | Has Tom/Bethan?           | (Nac) Ydy        | (S)he has(n't)     |
| Ydy’r car wedi?      | Has the car?              | (Nac) Ydy        | It has(n't)        |
| Ydy’r plant wedi?    | Have the children?        | (Nac) Ydyn       | They have(n't)     |

Particularly in North Wales, any questions in this tense can be answered using "Do" for "Yes" and "Naddo" for "No".

### 4. The Pluperfect Tense

The pluperfect tense is used to things that had already happened when talking about the past (sort of like the past's past). English sentences in the pluperfect tense look like this:

- **I had (already) left** the house when my neighbour called
- It was difficult asking for help in Finland because **I hadn't learnt** the language
- Daniel **had eaten** breakfast before he went to work.

In Welsh, this tense is formed by replacing the "yn" in the imperfect tense with "wedi". The above sentences in Welsh are:

- **Roeddwn i wedi gadael** y tŷ yn barod pan alwodd fy nghymydog
- Roedd e'n anodd gofyn am help yn y Ffindir achos **doeddwn i ddim wedi dysgu**'r iaith
- **Roedd Daniel wedi bwyta** brecwast cyn mynd i'r gwaith.

More examples in the **affirmative form**:

- Roeddwn i wedi byw yn Llandudno. - I had lived in Llandudno.
- Roeddech chi wedi gweithio’n galed. - You had worked hard.
- Roedd hi wedi siopa yn Llundain. - She had shopped in London.

Examples in the **negative form**:

- Doeddwn i ddim wedi byw yn Llandudno. - I hadn’t lived in Llandudno.
- Doeddech chi ddim wedi gweithio’n galed. - You hadn’t worked hard.
- Doedd hi ddim wedi siopa yn Llundain. - She hadn’t shopped in London.

Examples as **questions**:

- Oedd hi wedi siopa yn Llundain? Oedd. - Had she shopped in London? - Yes (she had).
- O'ch chi wedi gweithio’n galed? Nac oeddwn. - Had you worked hard? No (we hadn’t).
- Oeddwn i wedi byw yn Llandudno? Oeddet / Oeddech. - Had I lived in Llandudno? Yes (you had).

### 5. The Future Continuous Tense

The future continuous tense is used to talk about prolonged actions that will take place in the future. In English, it takes the form "X will be ………ing". In Welsh, it is formed so:

Correct form of the verb "bydd" + pronoun + "yn" + verb-noun

So, the English sentence "He will be playing" becomes "Bydd e'n chwarae".

Additionally, in the affirmative form, the particles "mi" (mostly used in North Wales) or "fe" (mostly used in South Wales) can be added at the start of the sentence. They have no real meaning by themselves, but add flow to the sentence, as they trigger a soft mutation (so the 'b' in "bydd" becomes 'f').

#### (a) The Affirmative forms

See the different forms below:

| Welsh                    | English                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Fe/Mi fydda i'n          | I will be                      |
| Fe/Mi fyddi di'n         | You’ll be (familiar, singular) |
| Fe/Mi fydd e'n/o'n       | He/It (m) will be              |
| Fe/Mi fydd hi'n          | She/It (f) will be             |
| Fe/Mi fyddwn ni'n        | We’ll be                       |
| Fe/Mi fyddwch chi'n      | You’ll be (polite/plural)      |
| Fe/Mi fyddan nhw'n       | They’ll be                     |
| Fe/Mi fydd Tom/Bethan yn | Tom/Bethan will be             |
| Fe/Mi fydd y car yn      | The car will be                |
| Fe/Mi fydd y plant yn    | The children will be           |
| Fe/Mi fydd ‘na           | There will be                  |

Without the particle at the start, the soft mutation doesn't occur:
| | |
| -- | -- |
| Bydda i'n | Byddwn ni'n |
| Byddi di'n | Byddwch chi'n |
| Bydd e'n/o'n | Byddan nhw'n |
| Bydd hi'n | |

Example sentences:

- Mi fydda’ i’n byw yn Llandudno y flwyddyn nesa’. - I'll be living in Llandudno next year.
- Fe fyddwch chi’n gweithio’n galed. - You’ll be working hard.
- Bydd hi’n siopa yn Llundain. - She’ll be shopping in London.

#### (b) The Negative forms

The particles "fe"/"mi" are NOT used in the negative, but the verb undergoes a soft mutation anyway (all conjugated negative verbs do), so the verb starts with an 'f'. The forms are below:

| Welsh              | English                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Fydda i ddim       | I won’t be              |
| Fyddi di ddim      | You won’t be            |
| Fyddwch chi ddim   | You’re won’t be         |
| Fydd y car ddim    | The car won’t be        |
| Fydd e ddim (S.W.) | He / It (masc) won’t be |
| Fydd o ddim (N.W.) | Fydda hi ddim           |
|                    | She / It (fem) won’t be |
| Fyddwn ni ddim     | We won’t be             |
| Fyddwch chi ddim   | You won’t be            |
| Fydd y plantddim\* | The children won’t be   |
| Fyddan nhw ddim    | They won’t be           |

Example sentences:

- Fydd hi ddim yn siopa yn Llundain. - She won’t be shopping in London.
- Fyddwch chi ddim yn gweithio’n galed. - You won’t be working hard.
- Fydda’ i ddim yn byw yn Llandudno. - I won’t be living in Llandudno.

#### (c) The Question forms and the ’No / Yes’ replies

| Welsh (Question)   | English (Question)                | Welsh (Response)     | English (Response)       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Fydda i?           | Will I be?                        | Bydda / Na fydda     | I will/won't be          |
| Fyddi di?          | Will you be? (familiar, singular) | Byddi / Na fyddi     | You will/won't be        |
| Fydd e/o? (S.W.)   | Will he/it (m) be?                | Bydd/Na fydd         | He/It (m) will/won't be  |
| Fydd hi?           | Will she/it (f) be?               | Bydd / Na fydd       | She/It (f) will/won't be |
| Fyddwn ni?         | Will we be?                       | Byddwn / Na fyddwn   | We will/won't be         |
| Fyddwch chi?       | Will you be? (polite/plural)      | Byddwch / Na fyddwch | You will/won't be        |
| Fyddan nhw?        | Will they be?                     | Bydda / Na fyddan    | They will/won't be       |
| Fydd Tom / Bethan? | Will Tom / Bethan be?             | Bydd / Na fydd       | (S)he will/won't be      |

| Fydd y plant?\*    | Will the children be?             | Byddan / Na fyddan   | They will/won't be       |

Example sentences:

- Fydd hi’n siopa yn Llundain? Bydd. - Will she be shopping in London? Yes (she will be).
- Fyddwch chi’n gweithio’n galed? Na fydda. - Will you be working hard? No (I won’t be).
- Fydda i’n byw yn Llandudno? - Byddi / Byddwch. - Will I be livimg in Llandudno? - Yes (you will be).

#### (d) Indefinite forms

As with the imperfect tense, the third person singular is also used for indefinite forms

Example sentences:

- Fe fydd lle/Mi fydd ‘na le - There will be room.
- Fydd lle?/Fydd 'na le? (S.W.) - Will there be room?
- Fydd dim lle/Fydd ‘na ddim lle - There won’t be room.

### 6. The Past Tense (see also No. 9 below)

#### (a) The Affirmative forms

These are the endings that are added to the root or stem of all regular verbs.

| Person                 | Singular       | Plural         |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| First (I/We)           | -ais i         | -on ni         |
| Second (You)           | -aist ti       | -och chi       |
| Third (He/She/It/They) | -odd e/o/hi    | -on nhw        |
| Nouns                  | -odd Tom/y car | -odd\* y plant |

\* As always, the singular third-person form is used for all nouns, including plural ones.

Sometimes, the 'ai' in -ais and -aist can be reduced to 'e' (-es, -est).

The stem or root of most verbs is found by dropping the final syllable or letter of the verb-noun:

| Verb    | English meaning | Stem/Root |
| ------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Cerdded | To walk         | Cerdd-    |
| Bwyta   | To eat          | Bwyt-     |
| Prynu   | To buy          | Pryn-     |
| Dysgu   | To learn        | Dysg-     |
| Canu    | To sing         | Can-      |
| Gweld   | To see          | Gwel-     |

Sometimes, the _entire_ verb-noun is used as the root, and the ending is simply placed after it:

| Verb    | English meaning | Stem/Root |
| ------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Eistedd | To sit          | Eistedd-  |
| Siarad  | To talk/speak   | Siarad-   |
| Edrych  | To look         | Edrych-   |
| Darllen | To read         | Darllen-  |

And some stems are irregular:

| Verb     | English meaning | Stem/Root   |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Dweud    | To say          | Dwed-       |
| Cyrraedd | To arrive       | Cyrrhaedd-  |
| Aros     | To stop/wait    | Arhos-      |
| Gwrando  | To listen       | Gwrand(aw)- |
| Gadael   | To leave        | Gadaw-      |
| Cymryd   | To take         | Cymer-      |
| Meddwl   | To think        | Meddyli-    |

Example using **dysgu** (to learn):

| Welsh           | English                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Dysgais i       | I learnt                        |
| Dysgaist ti     | You (familiar, singular) learnt |
| Dysgodd e/o     | He learnt                       |
| Dysgodd hi      | She learnt                      |
| Dysgon ni       | we learnt                       |
| Dysgoch chi     | You (polite/plural) learnt      |
| Dysgon nhw      | they learnt                     |
| Dysgodd Tom     | Tom learnt                      |
| Dysgodd y plant | The children learnt             |

As with the Continuous Future Tense, the parcticle ‘Mi/Fe’ can be placed in front of these verb forms, with the Soft Mutation as before (Mi ddysgais i, Fe ddysgaist ti, etc.)

Example sentences:

- Mi ddarllenodd Tom y papur yn y gwely. - Tom read the paper in bed.
- Fe welodd hi’r ffilm neithiwr. - She saw the film last night.
- Prynais i ffrog newydd ddoe. - I bought a new dress yesterday.

#### (b) The Negative forms

As before, the particle 'Mi/Fe' isn't used for negative statements, but the mutation remains (as all conjugated negative verbs have a mutation). Verbs starting with "P", "T" or "C" undergo the aspirate mutation (becoming "Ph", "Th" and "Ch" respectively), and all others undergo the soft mutation.

Usually, "ddim" is placed after the verb to show negation. Alternatively, the particle "ni" or "na" can be placed at the start. This particle doesn't affect the mutation (aspirate for P,T and C and soft otherwise) because it is implied when it isn't there.

Example: **dysgu**, which undergoes the **soft mutation**

| Welsh                 | English                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Ddysgais i ddim       | I didn't learn                        |
| Ddysgaist ti ddim     | You (familiar, singular) didn't learn |
| Ddysgodd e/o ddim     | He didn't learn                       |
| Ddysgodd hi ddim      | She didn't learn                      |
| Ddysgon ni ddim       | we didn't learn                       |
| Ddysgoch chi ddim     | You (polite/plural) didn't learn      |
| Ddysgon nhw ddim      | they didn't learn                     |
| Ddysgodd Tom ddim     | Tom didn't learn                      |
| Ddysgodd y plant ddim | The children didn't learn             |

Alternatively, one could write "Ni ddysgais i", or "Na ddysgoch chi".

Example sentences:

- Ni ddarllenodd Tom y papur yn y gwely. - Tom didn’t read the paper in bed.
- Welodd hi ddim ffilm neithiwr. - She didn’t see a film last night.
- Phrynais i ddim byd heddiw – I didn't buy anything today

Example: **cysgu** which undergoes the **aspirate** mutation:

| Welsh                 | English                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Chysgais i ddim       | I didn't sleep                        |
| Chysgaist ti ddim     | You (familiar, singular) didn't sleep |
| Chysgodd e/o ddim     | He didn't sleep                       |
| Chysgodd hi ddim      | She didn't sleep                      |
| Chysgon ni ddim       | we didn't sleep                       |
| Chysgoch chi ddim     | You (polite/plural) didn't sleep      |
| Chysgon nhw ddim      | they didn't sleep                     |
| Chysgodd Tom ddim     | Tom didn't sleep                      |
| Chysgodd y plant ddim | The children didn't sleep             |

Remember that the affirmative 'mi'/'fe' always triggers a soft mutation, whereas negation sometimes triggers the aspirate one, meaning the following forms are correct:

- Mi ddysgais i -> Ddysgais i ddim
- Fe gysgais i -> Chysgais i ddim
- Mi brynodd e -> Phrynodd e ddim

#### (c) The Question forms

Merely drop the positive marker ‘Mi / Fe’ , keep the Soft Mutation and adopt a questioning tone of voice.

The replies in this tense are the same in all persons:

- Yes - Do
- No - Naddo

| Welsh             | English                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Ddysgais i?       | Did I learn?                        |
| Ddysgaist ti?     | Did you (familiar, singular) learn? |
| Ddysgodd e/o?     | Did he learn?                       |
| Ddysgodd hi?      | Did she learn?                      |
| Ddysgon ni?       | Did we learn?                       |
| Ddysgoch chi?     | Did you (polite/plural) learn?      |
| Ddysgon nhw?      | Did they learn?                     |
| Ddysgodd Tom?     | Did Tom learn?                      |
| Ddysgodd y plant? | Did the children learn?             |

Example sentences:

- Ddarllenodd Tom y papur yn y gwely? Do. - Did Tom read the paper in bed/ - Yes.
- Welodd hi ffilm neithiwr? Naddo. - Did she see a film last night? No.
- Wisgaist ti ffrog newydd ddoe? Do. - Did you wear a new dress yesterday? Yes.

### 7. Irregular verbs - Past Tense

The 5 main irregular verbs in Welsh are:

- mynd - to go
- dod - to come
- gwneud - to do/make
- cael - to have/receive
- bod - to be

#### (a) The Affirmative forms

The first three form a group of their own as they follow a similar pattern.

| mynd               | dod                                      | gwneud               |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| Fe/ Mi es i        | Fe ddes i (S.W.) / Mi ddois i (N.W.)     | Fe/Mi wnes i         |
| Fe/Mi est ti       | Fe ddest ti (S.W.) / Mi ddoist ti (N.W.) | Fe/Mi wnest ti       |
| Fe/Mi aethoch chi  | Fe/Mi ddaethoch chi                      | Fe/Mi wnaethoch chi  |
| Fe/Mi aeth e/o     | Fe ddaeth e (S.W.)/Mi ddôth o (N.W.)     | Fe/Mi wnaeth e/o     |
| Fe/Mi aeth hi      | Fe/Mi ddaeth hi                          | Fe/Mi wnaeth hi      |
| Fe/Mi aeth Tom     | Fe/Mi ddaeth Tom                         | Fe/Mi wnaeth Tom     |
| Fe/Mi aethon ni    | Fe/Mi ddaethon ni                        | Fe/Mi wnaethon ni    |
| Fe/Mi aethoch chi  | Fe/Mi ddaethoch chi                      | Fe/Mi wnaethoch chi  |
| Fe/Mi aeth y plant | Fe/Mi ddaeth y plant                     | Fe/Mi wnaeth y plant |
| Fe/Mi aethon nhw   | Fe/Mi ddaethon nhw                       | Fe/Mi wnaethon nhw   |

Example sentences:

- Fe aeth y plant i’r ysgol ar y bws. - The children went to school on the bus.
- Mi aethon nhw i chwarae yn y parc ar ôl yr ysgol. - They went to play in the park after school.
- Fe / Mi es i i’r gwely’n gynnar neithiwr. - I went to bed early last night.
- Mi ddaeth Mair adre’ ddoe. - Mair came home yesterday.
- Fe ddaethon ni i’r parti mewn tacsi. - We came to the party in a taxi.
- Fe ddest ti i’r gwaith gyda Bill y bore ‘ma. - You came to work with Bill this morning.
- Mi wnaethon nhw’r gwaith ddydd Sadwrn. - They did the work on Saturday.
- Fe wnaeth hi gacen i de. - She made a cake for tea.
- Mi wnaethon ni sŵn. - We made a noise.

The Past Tense of ‘cael’ needs to be learnt separately. There are slight differences between the most common forms in North and South Wales respectively.

| South Wales       | North Wales      |
| :---------------- | :--------------- |
| Fe ges i          | Mi ges i         |
| Fe gest ti        | Mi gest ti       |
| Fe gawsoch chi    | Mi gaethoch chi  |
| Fe gafodd e       | Mi gaeth o       |
| Fe gafodd hi      | Mi gaeth hi      |
| Fe gafodd Beti    | Mi gaeth Beti    |
| Fe gawson ni      | Mi gaethon ni    |
| Fe gawsoch chi    | Mi gaethoch chi  |
| Fe gafodd y plant | Mi gaeth y plant |
| Fe gawson nhw     | Mi gaethon nhw   |

Example sentences:

- Mi ges i gar newydd y llynedd. - I got a new car last year.
- Fe gafodd / Mi gaeth Beti wobr yn yr eisteddfod. - Beti received a prize at the eisteddfod.
- Fe gawson / Mi gaethon nhw salad i swper. - They had salad for supper.
- Fe gafodd / Mi gaeth y llewod fwyd am ddau o’r gloch. - The lions had food at two o’clock.

The exact meaning of the Past Tense of ‘bod’ (to be) is difficult to convey as it doesn’t exist in English. So we have to translate it by using ‘went’ or ‘have been’ or ‘was /were’. Here are the forms:

| Singular            | Plural            |
| :------------------ | :---------------- |
| Fe / Mi fues i      | Fe / Mi fuon ni   |
| Fe / Mi fuest ti    | Fe / Mi fuoch chi |
| Fe / Mi fuodd e / o | Fe / Mi fuon nhw  |
| Fe / Mi fuodd hi    |                   |

Example sentences:

- Fe fues i yng Nghaerdydd ddoe. - I went to / was in Cardiff yesterday.
- Mi fuon nhw i Sbaen ym mis Awst. - They went to / were in Spain in August.
- Fuest ti erioed yn Ffrainc? – Have you ever been to France?
- Mi fuodd Gwyn mewn parti nos Sadwrn. - Gwyn went to / was in a party on Saturday night.

The ‘bues’ forms can also be used with another verb. The exact meaning in English is quite difficult to convey.

- Mi fuon ni’n siopa ddoe. - We went shopping yesterday.
- Fuoch chi'n siopa? – Have you been shopping?
- Fe fues i’n chwarae tennis ar ôl cinio ddydd Sadwrn. - I was/went playing tennis after lunch on Saturday.

#### (b) The Negative forms

The Negatives are formed in exactly the same way as regular verbs. Drop the positive marker ‘Mi / Fe’, keep the Soft Mutation (except for ‘cael’ which undertakes an Aspirate Mutation, as it starts with P, T or C) and add ‘ddim’.

| Verb-Noun (Infinitive) | Affirmative        | Negative          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Mynd                   | Fe/Mi aeth hi      | Aeth hi ddim      |
| Dod                    | Fe/Mi ddaethon nhw | Ddaethon nhw ddim |
| Gwneud                 | Fe/Mi wnest ti     | Wnest ti ddim     |
| Bod                    | Fe/Mi fuon ni      | Fuon ni ddim      |
| Cael                   | Fe/Mi ges i        | Ches i ddim       |

#### (c) The Question forms

The Questions are formed in exactly the same way as regular verbs. Drop the positive marker ‘Mi / Fe’ and keep the Soft Mutation.

| Verb-Noun | Affirmative | Question | Response
| Mynd | Fe/Mi aeth hi | Aeth hi? | Do/Naddo |
| Dod | Fe/Mi ddaethon nhw | Ddaethon nhw? | Do/Naddo |
| Gwneud | Fe/Mi wnaeth y plant | Wnaeth y plant ? | Do/Naddo |
| Bod | Fe/Mi fuon ni | Fuon ni? | Do/Naddo |
| Cael | Fe/Mi gest ti | Gest ti? | Do/Naddo |

### 8. Alternative method of forming conveying the ‘short’ Past Tense

Instead of adding endings to the root of each verb, it’s possible to use **any** verb-noun with the Future Tense forms of ‘gwneud’ - remembering that the verb-noun will undergo a Soft Mutation.

#### (a) The Affirmative forms

Here are some examples of sentences that use this form, along with the added verb-noun used. Remember, the forms of gwneud can be seen above in "Past Tense – Irregular Verbs".

| Welsh                                         | English                         | Verb-Noun           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Fe / Mi wnes’ i ddysgu’r gwaith.              | I learnt the work.              | Dysgu (to learn)    |
| Fe / Mi wnest ti brynu car newydd eleni.      | You bought a new car this year. | Prynu (to buy)      |
| Fe / Mi wnaeth Tom ddod adre’n gynnar heddiw. | Tom came home early today.      | Dod (to come)       |
| Fe / Mi wnaethon ni fynd i’r parti.           | We went to the party.           | Mynd (to go)        |
| Fe / Mi wnaethoch chi dalu’r bil.             | You paid the bill.              | Talu (to pay)       |
| Fe / Mi wnaethon nhw gofio’r gwaith.          | They remembered the work.       | Cofio (to remember) |

(b) The Negative forms

Notice that the mutation after the verb now happens on the word ‘dim’ which becomes ‘ddim’ - so the word which follows it doesn’t need to be mutated in these negative sentences. The main verb, gwneud, is also mutated as all conjugated negative verbs are.

| Welsh                                     | English                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Wnes i ddim dysgu’r gwaith.               | I didn’t learn the work.            |
| Wnest ti ddim prynu car newydd eleni      | You didn’t buy a new car this year. |
| Wnaeth Tom ddim dod adre’n gynnar heddiw. | Tom didn’t come home early today.   |
| Wnaethon ni ddim mynd i’r parti.          | We didn’t go to the party.          |
| Wnaethoch chi ddim talu’r bil.            | You didn’t pay the bill.            |
| Wnaethon nhw ddim cofio’r gwaith          | They didn’t remember the work.      |

#### (c) The Question forms

| Welsh                                       | English                                |

| Wnaethon nhw gofio’r gwaith? - Do.          | Did they remember the work? - Yes.     |

### 9. The Future Tense

Sometimes this is referred to as the "short" future tense, as opposed to the future continuous, which is a long-form tense.

#### (a) The Affirmative forms

These are the endings that are added to the root or stem of all regular verbs.

| Person                 | Singular            | Plural            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| First (I/We)           | -af/-a' i           | -an ni            |
| Second (You)           | -i di               | -wch chi          |
| Third (He/She/It/They) | -iff/ith e/o/hi     | -an nhw           |
| Nouns                  | -iff/-ith Tom/y car | -iff/-ith y plant |

These endings are added to the verb stems (see 6. The Past Tense)

Example: **dysgu** (to learn)

| Welsh                 | English                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Dysga’ i              | I’ll learn                        |
| Dysgi di              | you’ll (familiar, singular) learn |
| Dysgiff/ith e/o       | he’ll learn                       |
| Dysgiff/ith hi        | she’ll learn                      |
| Dysgwn ni             | we’ll learn                       |
| Dysgwch chi           | you’ll (polite/plural) learn      |
| Dysgan nhw            | they’ll learn                     |
| Dysgiff/ith Tom       | Tom will learn                    |
| Dysgiff/ith y plant\* | the children will learn           |

As mentioned elswhere above, ‘Mi / Fe’ can be placed front of these verb forms - with the Soft Mutation as before (e.g. Fe / Mi ddysga’ i, Fe / Mi ddysgwn ni, etc.)

Example sentences:

- Mi ddarllenith Tom y papur yn y gwely. - Tom will read the paper in bed.
- Fe weliff hi’r ffilm heno. - She‘ll see the film tonight.
- Fe / Mi bryna’ i ffrog newydd yfory. - I’ll buy a new dress tomorrow.

#### (b) The Negative forms

Drop the positive or affirmative marker ‘Mi / Fe’ but keep the Soft Mutation at the beginning of the verb forms - except those verbs which begin with c, p or t (which undergo an Aspirate Mutation).

| Affirmative                  | Negative                    |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Fe/Mi ddysga’ i              | Ddysga’ i ddim              |
| Fe/Mi ddysgi di              | Ddysgi di ddim              |
| Fe/Mi ddysgwch chi           | Ddysgwch chi ddim           |
| Fe/Mi ddysgiff e/hi (S.W.)   | Ddysgiff e/hi ddim          |
| Fe/Mi ddysgiff o/hi (N.W.)   | Ddysgiff o/hi ddim          |
| Fe/Mi ddysgiff/ith Tom       | Ddysgiff/ith Tom ddim       |
| Fe/Mi ddysgwn ni             | Ddysgwn ni ddim             |
| Fe/Mi ddysgwch chi           | Ddysgwch chi ddim           |
| Fe/Mi ddysgiff/ith y plant\* | Ddysgiff/ith y plant ddim\* |
| Fe/Mi ddysgan nhw            | Ddysgan nhw ddim            |

Example sentences:

- Ddarlleniff/ith Tom ddim papur yn y gwely. - Tom won’t read a paper in bed.
- Weliff/ith hi ddim ffilm heno. - She won’t see a film tonight.
- Wisga’ i ddim ffrog newydd yfory. - I won’t wear a new dress tomorrow.

As stated above, verbs which begin with c, p or t begin with an Aspirate Mutation in the Negative Past Tense forms. See A.M. rule 7.

Example: **cysgu** (to sleep)

| Affirmative           | Negative              |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Fe/Mi gysga’ i        | Chysga’ i ddim        |
| Fe/Mi gysgi di        | Chysgi di ddim        |
| Fe/Mi gysgiff/ith e/o | Chysgiff/ith e/o ddim |
| Fe/Mi gysgiff/ith hi  | Chysgiff/ith hi ddim  |
| Fe/Mi gysgwn ni       | Chysgwn ni ddim       |
| Fe/Mi gysgwch chi     | Chysgwch chi ddim     |
| Fe/Mi gysgan nhw      | Chysgan nhw ddim      |
| Fe/Mi gysgiff/ith Tom | Chysgiff/ith Tom ddim |

#### (c) The Question forms

Merely drop the positive marker ‘Mi / Fe’ , keep the Soft Mutation and adopt a questioning tone of voice.

The replies in this tense are based on the verb ‘gwneud’:

| Welsh (Question) | English (Question) | Welsh (Response)
| Ddysga’ i? | Will I learn? | Gwnaf/Wna' i |
| Ddysgi di? | Will you learn? | Gwnei |
| Ddysgiff e? (S.W.) | Will he learn? | Gwnaiff (S.W.) |
| Ddysgith o? (N.W.) | Will he learn? | Gwneith (N.W.) |
| Ddysgiff/ith hi? | Will she learn? | Gwnaiff/Gwneith |
| Ddysgwn ni? | Will we learn? | Gwnawn |
| Ddysgwch chi? | Will you learn? | Gwnewch |
| Ddysgan nhw? | Will they learn? | Gwnân |
| Ddysgiff/ith Tom? | Will Tom learn? | Gwnaiff/Gwneith |
| Ddysgiff/ith y plant? | Will the children learn? | Gwnân |

The ‘No’ replies are formed by placing ‘Na’ in front of the ‘Yes’ forms which undergo a Soft Mutation. See S.M. rule 24.

- Gwnaf - Yes (I will) -> Na wnaf – No (I won't)
- Gwnawn - Yes (we will) -> Na wnawn- No (we won’t)

Alternatively, a soft mutation on the verb followed by "ddim" can be used:

- Gwna' - Yes (I will) -> Wna' i ddim – No (I won't)
- Gwnawn - Yes (we will) -> Wnawn ni ddim- No (we won’t)

Example sentences:

- Ddarlleniff Tom y papur yn y gwely? Gwnaiff. - Will Tom read the paper in bed? Yes.
- Welan nhw ffilm heno? Wnân nhw ddim. – Will they see a film tonight? No, they won't.
- Wisgi di ffrog newydd yfory? Wna’ i. - Will you wear a new dress tomorrow? Yes.

### 10. Irregular verbs - Future Tense

The 5 main irregular verbs in Welsh are:

- mynd - to go
- gwneud - to do/make
- cael - to have/receive
- dod - to come
- bod - to be

#### (a) The Affirmative forms

The first three form a group of their own as they follow a similar pattern.

| mynd                    | cael                      | gwneud                      |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------- |
| Fe/Mi af/a' i           | Fe/Mi gaf/ga' i           | Fe/Mi wnaf/wna' i           |
| Fe/Mi ei ti             | Fe/Mi gei di              | Fe/Mi wnei ti               |
| Fe/Mi ewch chi          | Fe/Mi gewch chi           | Fe/Mi wnewch chi            |
| Fe/Mi aiff/eith e/o     | Fe/Mi gaiff/geith e/o     | Fe/Mi wnaiff/wneith e/o     |
| Fe/Mi aiff/eith hi      | Fe/Mi gaiff/geith hi      | Fe/Mi wnaiff/wneith hi      |
| Fe/Mi aiff/eith Tom     | Fe/Mi gaiff/geith Tom     | Fe/Mi wnaiff/wneith Tom     |
| Fe/Mi awn ni            | Fe/Mi gawn ni             | Fe/Mi wnawn ni              |
| Fe/Mi ewch chi          | Fe/Mi gewch chi           | Fe/Mi wnewch chi            |
| Fe/Mi aiff/eith y plant | Fe/Mi gaiff/geith y plant | Fe/Mi wnaiff/wneith y plant |
| Fe/Mi ân nhw            | Fe/Mi gân nhw             | Fe/Mi wnân nhw              |

Fe / Mi wnân nhw

Example sentences:

- Fe aiff y plant i’r ysgol ar y bws. - The children will go to school on the bus.
- Mi ân nhw i chwarae yn y parc ar ôl yr ysgol. - They’ll go to play in the park after school.
- Fe / Mi af fi i’r gwely’n gynnar heno. - I’ll go to bed early tonight.
- Mi gaf fi gar newydd y flwyddyn nesa’.. - I’ll get a new car next year.
- Fe gaiff Beti wobr yn yr eisteddfod. - Beti will get a prize at the eisteddfod.
- Mi gân nhw salad i swper. - They’ll have salad for supper
- Mi wnân nhw’r gwaith ddydd Sadwrn. - They’ll do the work on Saturday.
- Fe wnaiff hi gacen i de. - She’ll make a cake for tea.
- Mi wnawn ni sŵn. - We’ll make a noise.

The Future Tense of ‘dod’ is a little different:

| Welsh              | English       | Welsh            | English      |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Fe/Mi ddof/ddo' fi | I'll come     | Fe/Mi ddown ni   | We'll come   |
| Fe/Mi ddoi di      | You'll come   | Fe/Mi ddewch chi | You'll come  |
| Fe/Mi ddaw e/o/hi  | (S)he'll come | Fe/Mi ddôn nhw   | They'll come |

Example sentences:

- Mi ddaw Mair adre’ yfory. - Mair will come home tomorrow.
- Fe ddown ni i’r parti mewn tacsi. - We’ll come to the party in a taxi
- Fe ddoi di i’r gwaith gyda Bill. - You’ll come to work with Bill.

#### (b) The Negative forms

The Negatives are formed in exactly the same way as regular verbs. Drop the positive marker ‘Mi / Fe’, keep the Soft Mutation (except for ‘cael’ which undertakes an Aspirate Mutation) and add ‘ddim’.

- Fe / Mi ân nhw -> Ân nhw ddim
- Fe / Mi ddaw hi -> Ddaw hi ddim
- Fe / Mi wnei di -> Wnei di ddim
- Fe / Mi fydd y plant -> Fydd y plant ddim
- Fe / Mi gawn ni -> Chawn ni ddim

#### (c) The Question forms

The Questions are formed in exactly the same way as regular verbs. Drop the positive marker ‘Mi / Fe’ and keep the Soft Mutation.

- Fe / Mi ân nhw -> Ân nhw?
- Fe / Mi ddaw hi -> Ddaw hi?
- Fe / Mi wnei di -> Wnei di?
- Fe / Mi fydd y plant -> Fydd y plant?
- Fe / Mi gawn ni -> Gawn ni?

Note that the future tense of ‘cael’ is also used to ask for permission (‘May I?’ and ‘May I have?’):

- Ga’ i fynd? Cei. - May I go? Yes, you may.
- Ga’ i ddiod? Na chei. - May I have a drink? No, you may not.
- Gei di aros? - May you stay?/Are you allowed to stay?
- Gaiff/Geith John lifft? - May/Can John have a lifft?

### 11. Alternative method of forming conveying the ‘short’ Future Tense

Instead of adding endings to the root of each verb (as seen in No. 10 above), it’s possible to use any verb noun with the Future Tense forms of ‘gwneud’ - remembering that the verb- noun will undergo a Soft Mutation. See S.M. rule 19.

#### (a) The Affirmative forms

- Fe / Mi wna’ i ddysgu’r gwaith. - I’ll learn the work.
- Fe / Mi wnei di brynu car newydd eleni. - You’ll buy a new car this year.
- Fe / Mi wnaiff / wneith Tom ddod adre’n gynnar heddiw. - Tom will come home early today.
- Fe / Mi wnawn ni fynd i’r parti. - We’ll go to the party.
- Fe / Mi wnewch chi dalu’r bil. - You’ll pay the bill.
- Fe / Mi wnân nhw gofio’r gwaith. - They’ll remember the work.

#### (b) The Negative forms

Notice that the mutation after the verb now happens on the word ‘dim’ which becomes ‘ddim’ - so the word which follows it doesn’t need to be mutated in these negative sentences.

- Wna’ i ddim dysgu’r gwaith. - I won’t learn the work.
- Wnei di ddim prynu car newydd eleni - You won’t buy a new car this year.
- Wnaiff / Wneith Tom ddim dod adre’n gynnar heddiw. - Tom won’t come home early today.
- Wnawn ni ddim mynd i’r parti. - We won’t go to the party.
- Wnewch chi ddim talu’r bil. - You won’t pay the bill.
- Wnân nhw ddim cofio’r gwaith - They won’t remember the work.

#### (c) The question forms

- Wna’ i ddysgu’r gwaith? Gwnei / Gwnewch. - Will I learn the work? Yes (you will).
- Wnei di brynu car newydd eleni? Na wnaf. - Will you buy a new car this year? - No (I won’t).
- Wnaiff / Wneith Tom ddod adre’n gynnar heddiw? Gwnaiff / Gwneith. - Will Tom come home early today? Yes (he will).
- Wnawn ni fynd i’r parti? Na wnawn. - Will we go to the party? No (we won’t).
- Wnewch chi dalu’r bil? Gwnawn / Gwnaf. - Will you pay the bill? Yes (we will) / Yes (I will).
- Wnân nhw gofio’r gwaith? Gwnân. - Will they remember the work? Yes (they will).

### 12. The Conditional (‘would’) Tense.

As mentioned above, the participles ‘Mi / Fe’ are used in front of these forms in normal speech. to

#### (a) The Affirmative forms

| Welsh               | English            |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Fe/Mi faswn i       | I would            |
| Fe/Mi faset ti      | you (fam) would    |
| Fe/Mi fasech chi    | you (pol) would    |
| Fe/Mi fasai fe/fo   | he would           |
| Fe/Mi fasai hi      | she would          |
| Fe/Mi fasai Dilys   | Dilys would        |
| Fe/Mi fasen ni      | we would           |
| Fe/Mi fasech chi    | you would          |
| Fe/Mi fasai’r plant | the children would |
| Fe/Mi fasen nhw     | they would         |

These forms are again followed by the linking ‘yn’ which causes no mutation.

#### (b) The Negative forms

| Welsh              | English               |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Faswn i ddim       | I wouldn’t            |
| Faset ti ddim      | you (fam) wouldn’t    |
| Fasech chi ddim    | you (pol) wouldn’t    |
| Fasai fe/fo ddim   | he wouldn’t           |
| Fasai hi ddim      | she wouldn’t          |
| Fasai Dilys ddim   | Dilys wouldn’t        |
| Fasen ni ddim      | we wouldn’t           |
| Fasech chi ddim    | you wouldn’t          |
| Fasai’r plant ddim | the children wouldn’t |
| Fasen nhw ddim     | they wouldn’t         |

#### (c) The Question and Answer forms

| Welsh (Question) | English (Question)  | Welsh (Response) | English (Response) |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Faswn i?         | Would I?            | Baswn            | (Yes,) I would.    |
| Faset ti?        | Would you?          | Baset            | (Yes,) you would.  |
| Fasai fe/fo?     | Would he?           | Basai            | (Yes,) he would.   |
| Fasai hi?        | Would she?          | Basai            | (Yes,) she would.  |
| Fasen ni?        | Would we?           | Basen            | (Yes,) we would.   |
| Fasech chi?      | Would you?          | Basech           | (Yes,) you would.  |
| Fasen nhw?       | Would they?         | Basen            | (Yes,) they would. |
| Fasai Dilys?     | Would Dilys?        | Basai            | (Yes,) she would.  |
| Fasai’r plant?\* | Would the children? | Basen            | (Yes,) they would. |

The Negative replies are formed as usual by placing ‘Na’ in front of the Affirmative forms, or using a soft mutation followed by "ddim":

- Baswn - Yes (I would) -> Na faswn/Faswn i ddim - No (I wouldn’t)
- Basech - Yes (you would) -> Na fasech/Fasech chi ddim - No (you wouldn’t)

Example sentences:

- Fe / Mi fasen ni’n bwyta sbageti yn yr Eidal. - We would eat spaghetti in Italy.
- Faswn i ddim yn gwneud sŵn. - I wouldn’t make a noise.
- Fasai’r plant yn cerdded i’r ysgol? Basen. - Would the children walk to school? Yes, they would.

### 13. The second half of ‘would’ sentences

The second half of a ‘would’ sentence, whether it comes at the beginning or at the end, usually begins with ‘if…..’

In English, the verb which follows is often a Past Tense verb - but on further investigation, it isn’t really the Past Tense that’s required.

| Example 1                                                  | Example 2                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I would buy a new car, **if I had** enough money.          | **If they went** to Moscow, they would see the Kremlin.       |
| I would buy a new car, **if I were to have** enough money. | **If they were to go** to Moscow, they would see the Kremlin. |
| I would buy a new car, **if I would have** enough money.   | **If they would go** to Moscow, they would see the Kremlin.   |

#### The ‘if…..’ pattern in Welsh

| Welsh         | English                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Taswn i       | if I were to            |
| Taset ti      | if you (fam) were to    |
| Tasech chi    | if you (pol) were to    |
| Tasai fe/fo   | if he were to           |
| Tasai hi      | if she were to          |
| Tasai Dilys   | if Dilys were to        |
| Tasen ni      | if we were to           |
| Tasech chi    | if you were to          |
| Tasai’r plant | if the children were to |
| Tasen nhw     | if they were to         |

These forms are again followed by the linking ‘yn’ which causes no mutation.

Example sentences:

- Fe / Mi faswn i’n gweld Tŵr Eiffel, taswn i’n mynd i Baris. - I would see the Eiffel Tower, if I went were to go to Paris.
- Taset ti’n mynd i’r parti, fe faswn i’n mynd hefyd. - If you went to the party, I would go too.
- Tasen nhw’n gyfoethog, fe fasen nhw’n prynu iot.- If they were wealthy, they would buy a yacht.

### 14. The short ‘would like’ pattern

#### (a) The Affirmative forms

| Long form                    | Short form           | English                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Fe/Mi faswn i’n hoffi        | Fe/Mi hoffwn i       | I‘d like                |
| Fe/Mi faset ti’n hoffi       | Fe/Mi hoffet ti      | You’d like              |
| Fe/Mi fasai fe/fo’n hoffi    | Fe/Mi hoffai fe/fo   | He’d like               |
| Fe/Mi fasai hi’n hoffi       | Fe/Mi hoffai hi      | She’d like              |
| Fe/Mi fasen ni’n hoffi       | Fe/Mi hoffen ni      | We’d like               |
| Fe/Mi fasech chi’n hoffi     | Fe/Mi hoffech chi    | You’d like              |
| Fe/Mi fasen nhw’n hoffi      | Fe/Mi hoffen nhw     | They’d like             |
| Fe/Mi fasai Dilys yn hoffi   | Fe/Mi hoffai Dilys   | Dilys would like        |
| Fe/Mi fasai’r plant yn hoffi | Fe/Mi hoffai’r plant | The children would like |

There is no linking ‘yn’after these forms, as they are short-form, and the verb-nouns which follow these short Affirmative forms undergo a Soft Mutation. See S.M. No.25.

#### (b) The Negative forms

| Welsh                 | English                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Hoffwn i ddim         | I wouldn’t like            |
| Hoffet ti ddim        | You wouldn’t like (fam)    |
| Hoffech chi ddim      | You wouldn’t like (pol)    |
| Hoffai fe/fo ddim     | He wouldn’t like           |
| Hoffai hi ddim        | She wouldn’t like          |
| Hoffai Dilys ddim     | Dilys wouldn’t like        |
| Hoffen ni ddim        | We wouldn’t like           |
| Hoffech chi ddim      | You wouldn’t like          |
| Hoffai’r plant ddim\* | The children wouldn’t like |
| Hoffen nhw ddim       | They wouldn’t like         |

There is no linking ‘yn’after these forms, as they are short-form, and the verb-nouns which follow these short Affirmative forms do not undergo a Soft Mutation because the "ddim" beforehand is mutated instead. See S.M. No.25.

#### (c) The Question and answer forms

| Welsh (Question) | English (Question)       | Welsh (Response) |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Hoffwn i?        | Would I like?            | (Na) hoffwn      |
| Hoffet ti?       | Would you like? (fam)    | (Na) hoffet      |
| Hoffech chi?     | Would you like? (pol)    | (Na) hoffech     |
| Hoffai fe/fo?    | Would he like?           | (Na) hoffai      |
| Hoffai hi?       | Would she like?          | (Na) hoffai      |
| Hoffai Dilys?    | Would Dilys like?        | (Na) hoffai      |
| Hoffen ni?       | Would we like?           | (Na) hoffen      |
| Hoffech chi?     | Would you like?          | (Na) hoffech     |
| Hoffai’r plant?  | Would the children like? | (Na) hoffen      |
| Hoffen nhw?      | Would they like?         | (Na) hoffen      |

There is no linking ‘yn’ after these forms and the verb-nouns which follow these short Question forms undergo a Soft Mutation. See S.M. No.25.

Example sentences:

- Fe / Mi hoffai’r plant fynd i weld Mickey Mouse. - The children would like to go to see Mickey Mouse.
- Hoffen ni ddim bwyta malwod. - We wouldn’t like to eat snails.
- Hoffet ti gael porc i ginio? Hoffwn. - Would you like to have pork for dinner? Yes (I would).

### 15. The ‘ought to / should’ verb forms

#### (a) The Affirmative forms

| Welsh                | English                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Fe/Mi ddylwn i       | I ought to/should            |
| Fe/Mi ddylet ti      | You ought to/should          |
| Fe/Mi ddylai fe/fo   | He ought to/should           |
| Fe/Mi ddylai hi      | She ought to/should          |
| Fe/Mi ddylen ni      | We ought to/should           |
| Fe/Mi ddylech chi    | You ought to/should          |
| Fe/Mi ddylen nhw     | They ought to/should         |
| Fe/Mi ddylai Dilys   | Dilys ought to/should        |
| Fe/Mi ddylai’r plant | The children ought to/should |

Notice that there is no linking ‘yn’ after this pattern and the verb-noun which follows the Affirmative forms undergoes a Soft Mutation. See S.M. No.26.

#### (b) The Negative forms

| Welsh                 | English                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Ddylwn i ddim         | I shouldn’t            |
| Ddylet ti ddim        | You shouldn’t (fam)    |
| Ddylech chi ddim      | You shouldn’t (pol)    |
| Ddylai fe/fo ddim     | He shouldn’t           |
| Ddylai hi ddim        | She shouldn’t          |
| Ddylai Dilys ddim     | Dilys shouldn’t        |
| Ddylen ni ddim        | We shouldn’t           |
| Ddylech chi ddim      | You shouldn’t          |
| Ddylai’r plant ddim\* | The children shouldn’t |
| Ddylen nhw ddim       | They shouldn’t         |

Notice that there is no linking ‘yn’ after this pattern and the verb-noun follows immediately without a mutation.

#### (c) The Question and answer forms

| Welsh (Question)  | English (Question)   | Welsh (Response) |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Ddylwn i?         | Should I?            | Dylet/Dylech     |
| Ddylet ti?        | Should you? (fam)    | Dylwn            |
| Ddylech chi?      | Should you? (pol)    | Dylwn            |
| Ddylai fe/fo?     | Should he?           | Dylai            |
| Ddylai hi?        | Should she?          | Dylai            |
| Ddylai Dilys?     | Should Dilys?        | Dylai            |
| Ddylen ni?        | Should we?           | Dylen/Dylech     |
| Ddylech chi?      | Should you?          | Dylen            |
| Ddylai’r plant?\* | Should the children? | Dylen            |
| Ddylen nhw?       | Should they?         | Dylen            |

The verb-noun which follows the Question forms undergoes a Soft Mutation. See S.M. No.26.

As usual the Negative reply is formed by placing ‘Na’ in front of the Affirmative forms - remembering the Soft Mutation. See S.M. rule 24. Alternatively, use a soft mutation followed by "ddim".

- Dylwn - Yes (I should) -> Na ddylwn/Ddylwn i ddim - No ( I shouldn’t)
- Dylet - Yes (you should) -> Na ddylet - No (you shouldn’t)

Example sentences:

- Fe / Mi ddylai’r plant fynd i’r gwely’n gynnar heno. - The children ought to go to bed early tonight.
- Ddylen ni ddim yfed gormod o alcohol. - We shouldn’t drink too much alcohol.
- Ddylet ti gael salad i ginio? - Dylwn. - Should you have salad for dinner? - Yes (I should).

### 16. The ‘must / have to’ pattern

#### (a) The Affirmative forms

| Welsh                      | English                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| (Mae) rhaid i mi/fi        | I must/have to            |
| (Mae) rhaid i ti           | you must/have to          |
| (Mae) rhaid i Tom Mair     | Tom/Mair must/has to      |
| (Mae) rhaid iddo fo (N.W.) | he must/has to            |
| (Mae) rhaid iddo fe (S.W.) | he must/has to            |
| (Mae) rhaid iddi hi        | she must/has to           |
| (Mae) rhaid i ni           | We must/have to           |
| (Mae) rhaid i chi          | you must/have to          |
| (Mae) rhaid i’r plant      | the children must/have to |
| (Mae) rhaid iddyn nhw      | they must/have to         |

‘Mae’ is often omitted in ordinary speech.

#### (b) The Negative forms

To make a negative statement, change ‘Mae’ to ‘Does dim’.

- Does dim rhaid i ni - We don’t have to
- Does dim rhaid iddi (hi) - She doesn’t have to

#### (c) The Question forms

To ask a question, change ‘Mae’ to ‘Oes?’

- Oes rhaid i chi? - Must you / Do you have to?
- Oes rhaid iddyn nhw? - Must they / Do they have to?

#### (d) Past Tesne

In the Past Tense use ‘Roedd’, ‘Oedd?’ and ‘Doedd dim’.

| Welsh                      | English            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Roedd rhaid i mi/fi        | I had to           |
| Roedd rhaid iddo fo (N.W.) | he had to          |
| Oedd rhaid i ti?           | Did you have to?   |
| Oedd rhaid iddyn nhw?      | Did they have to?  |
| Doedd dim rhaid i chi      | You didn’t have to |
| Doedd dim rhaid i ni       | We didn’t have to  |

#### (e) Soft Mutation

The verb noun which follows the full ‘rhaid’ (must) pattern undergoes a Soft Mutation. See S.M. rule 16. We often omit ‘Mae’ in ordinary speech.

- (Mae) rhaid iddyn nhw **dd**ysgu Cymraeg. - They must learn Welsh.
- Oes rhaid i ti **f**ynd adre’? - Must you / Do you have to go home?

#### (f) Initial verb form

You’ll notice that the initial verb form which is used with ‘rhaid’ is always in the 3rd person singular. This is true of all tenses.

- Mae rhaid i …………
- Roedd rhaid i ………….
- Fe / Mi fydd rhaid i ……………
- Tasai rhaid i ………………
- Fe / Mi fasai rhaid i ………………

#### (g) Shortened form

The full pattern doesn’t have to be used. It’s possible to make an impersonal statement by placing a verb noun immediately after ‘rhaid’ - thus avoiding the mutation!

- (Mae) rhaid mynd i’r gwely’n gynnar heno. - One (i.e. I / We ) must go to bed early tonight.
- (Mae) rhaid ffonio John. - One (i.e. I / We ) must telephone John.

### 17. Prepositions which follow certain verbs

It is important to learn some verbs with the preposition which follows them - because these can vary from language to language. This is arguably the most difficult element in any language as there is often no logical explanation for the use of a particular preposition after a certain verb (consider the following in English - fill in, fill out, fill up; work out; cut up; drink up; listen to; think of; round up; bring about etc).

| Welsh            | English               |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| edrych ar        | to look at            |
| gwrando ar       | to listen to          |
| siarad â/efo     | to talk/speak to      |
| cwrdd â          | to meet               |
| dweud wrth       | to tell               |
| gweithio i       | to work for           |
| gofyn i          | to ask (someone)      |
| rhoi i           | to give to            |
| edrych ymlaen at | to look forward to    |
| cofio at         | to remember to        |
| anfon at         | to send to (a person) |

Remember that these prepositions have personal forms - they conjugate, See Section CH for more details.

- Dw i’n hoffi edrych arno fe / fo.
- Wyt ti wedi ysgrifennu ati hi?

### 18. The Command forms

#### (a) Regular verbs

Most verbs fall into this group.

Endings are added to the stem or root of the verb This is usually found by dropping the final syllable (see section on verb stems).

##### Formal/Plural form

The ending to use with "chi" (when talking formally/politely or with multiple people) is **-wch**

| Verb-Noun              | Command     |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| e.g. cerdded (to walk) | cerddwch!   |
| bwyta (to eat)         | bwytwch!    |
| prynu (to buy)         | prynwch!    |
| dysgu (to learn)       | dysgwch!    |

| ---------------------- | --------- |
| cerdded (to walk)      | cerdda!   |
| bwyta (to eat)         | bwyta!    |

| siarad (to talk/speak) | siarada!  |
| edrych (to look)       | edrycha!  |
| darllen (to read)      | darllena! |

The noun which directly follows a command ( the direct object)undergoes a Soft Mutation. See S.M. rule 31.

| Welsh             | English             |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Dysgwch Gymraeg!  | Learn Welsh!        |
| Darllenwch bapur! | Read a paper!       |
| Daliwch y lein!   | Hold the line!      |
| Ffoniwch heno!    | Telephone tonight!  |
| Pryna gar newydd! | Buy a new car!      |
| Siarada Gymraeg!  | Speak Welsh!        |
| Cofia fi ati hi!  | Remember me to her! |

#### (b) Exceptions

There is sometimes a change of spelling in the command form.

| Verb-Noun                 | Command                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| gwrando ar (to listen to) | gwrandewch!/gwrandewa!  |
| gadael (to leave)         | gadewch!/gadewa!        |
| dweud (to say)            | dwedwch!/dweda!         |
| cyrraedd (to arrive)      | cyrhaeddwch!/cyrhaedda! |
| aros (to stop/wait)       | arhoswch!/arhosa!       |
| cymryd (to take)          | cymerwch!/cymera!       |

Examples:

- Gwrandewch arna i! - Listen to me!
- Gadewch iddi (hi) fynd! - Let her go!

#### (c) Irregular verbs

These are all different and have to be learnt individually. Here are the three most often used.

| Verb-Noun     | Formal/Plural Command       | Informal Singular Command |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| bod (to be)   | byddwch                     | bydd / bydda              |
| mynd (to go)  | ewch (S.W.) / cerwch (N.W.) | cer (S.W.) / dos (N.W.)   |
| dod (to come) | dewch (S.W.) / dowch (N.W.) | dere (S.W.) / tyrd (N.W.) |

Examples:

- Byddwch yn blant da! - Be good children!
- Bydd yn ofalus!/Bydda'n ofalus! - Be careful!
- Ewch / Cerwch mewn tacsi! - Go by taxi!=
- Dos / Cer i’r gwely! - Go to bed!
- Dewch i mewn! - Come in!
- Tyrd / Dere yma! - Come here!

#### (d) Negative commands

The negative commands (Don’t) are:

- Peidiwch (â) – polite/plural
- Paid (â) – familiar singular

For example:

- Peidiwch (â) siarad Saesneg! - Don’t speak English!
- Paid (â) rhedeg ar y lawnt! - Don’t run on the lawn!

Technically, the preposition ‘â’ should form part of this pattern, but it is often dropped in speech. If the ‘â’ is used, notice the Aspirate Mutation. (c >ch, p>ph, t>th) See A.M. rule 11:

- Peidiwch â cherdded ar y lawnt - Don’t walk on the lawn!
- Paid â phrynu sglodion! - Don’t buy chips!

‘Â’ becomes ‘ag’ in front of a word which begins with a vowel:

- Peidiwch ag eistedd wrth y ffenest! - Don’t sit by the window!
- Paid ag agor y ffenest! - Don’t open the window!
