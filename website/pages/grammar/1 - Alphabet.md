## 1. The Alphabet (Yr Wyddor)

Welsh, like English, uses the Latin alphabet, but it has 29 letters instead of English's 26. This is because Welsh includes some "double letters" (made up of 2 characters) in its alphabet because they make distinct sounds. The letters K, Q, V, X, and Z are also omitted from the Welsh alphabet.

Grammatically speaking, Welsh considers W and Y to be vowels, with H sometimes included. A "w" can also make a consonant sound, but it is still considered a vowel.

The Welsh Alphabet:

A B C Ch D Dd E F Ff G Ng H I J L Ll M N O P Ph R Rh S T Th U W Y

Welsh spelling is phonetic, meaning it is fairly regular and the sound a word makes can be predicted based on its spelling. Not every letter in Welsh makes the same sound as it does in English. See below for the sounds that each letter makes.

### Vowels

Vowels in Welsh have long and short variations.

### Diphthongs

Diphthongs are combinations of two vowel sounds together. In Welsh, diphthongs are very straightforward and sound as they're spelt (though "ae" can have one of two pronunciations).
