## C. Ansoddeiriau - Adjectives

1. Nearly all adjectives follow the noun in Welsh.

   - e.g. a small/little boy - bachgen bach
   - a big/large car - car mawr
   - a high mountain - mynydd uchel
   - a long film - ffilm hir

   There are a few exceptions to this rule - ‘hen’ (old), ‘hoff’ (favourite) and ‘prif’ (main / chief) are three of them.

   - e.g. an old man - hen ddyn
   - favourite food - hoff fwyd
   - main character - prif gymeriad

   You’ll notice that by standing in front of the noun they cause the noun to undergo a Soft Mutation. See S.M. rule 8.

2. When an adjective follows a singular, feminine noun it undergoes a Soft Mutation. See S.M. rule 7.

   - e.g. merch fach - a little girl
   - cadair fawr - a large chair
   - siop ddiddorol - an interesting shop
   - ysgol dda - a good school

   Sometimes another noun can be used as an adjective or a descriptive word

   - e.g. siop fara - bread shop (baker’s)
   - siop gig - meat shop (butcher’s)

3. When an adjective stands alone in a sentence (i.e. it doesn’t stand next to the noun it describes) the linking word ‘yn’ is used in front of it.

   - e.g. The bus is early. - Mae’r bws yn gynnar.
   - The car isn’t old. - Dydy’r car ddim yn hen.
   - The children were cold. - Roedd y plant yn oer.

   This word ‘yn’ causes the adjective to undergo a Soft Mutation. See S.M. rule 12.

   - e.g. The castle is big. - Mae’r castell yn fawr.
   - The film is interesting. - Mae’r ffilm yn ddiddorol.
   - We were hot. - Roedden ni’n boeth.

4. We can qualify our adjectives by placing ‘rhy’ (too), ‘gweddol’ (quite / fairly),’eitha’ (quite / fairly) or ‘lled’ (quite / fairly) between ‘yn’ and the adjective. ‘Gweddol’ will undergo a Soft Mutation after ‘yn’ but ‘rhy’ and ‘lled’ will not (as rh and ll are exceptions to the rule). The full form is ‘eithaf’ but the final ‘f’ is normally dropped in the spoken language. This happens in most words which end in ‘f’. All except ‘eitha’ cause the adjective which follows to undertake a Soft Mutation. See S.M. rule 9.
   - e.g. yn weddol ddiddorol - fairly interesting
   - yn rhy boeth - too hot
   - yn lled dal - quite tall
   - yn eitha tew - quite fat

### Comparison of adjectives

As in English there are three methods of comparing adjectives in Welsh.

### The largest group - to which appropriate endings are added

| Language | Adjective | Equative   | Comparative   | Superlative                  |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| English  | tall      | as tall as | taller than   | the tallest                  |
| Welsh    | tal       | mor dal â  | yn dalach na  | y tala (m + pl) / y dala (f) |
| English  | red       | as red as  | redder than   | the reddest                  |
| Welsh    | coch      | mor goch â | yn gochach na | y cocha (m + pl)/y gocha (f) |

The Equative degree can also be formed by adding the ending -ed to these ‘short’ adjectives and by placing the word ‘cyn’ in front.

- e.g. mor dal â - cyn daled â
- mor goch â - cyn goched â

1. Notice the Soft Mutation after ‘mor’ and ‘cyn’. See S.M. rule 27. Note also that we do not place ‘yn’ in front of either ‘mor’ or ‘cyn’.
   - e.g. mae hi mor dal â fi / mae hi cyn daled â fi
2. Notice the Soft Mutation after ‘yn’. See S.M. rule 28.
   - e.g. mae hi’n dalach na fi
   - mae rum yn gryfach na gwin
3. Notice the Soft Mutation after ‘y’ in the Superlative degree when it refers to a feminine noun. See S.M. rule 29.
   - e.g. John oedd y tala / Ann oedd y dala
4. Notice the Aspirate Mutation after both ‘â’ and ‘na’. See A.M. rules 8 and 9.
   - e.g. mor dal â choeden / cyn daled â choeden - as tall as a tree
   - yn gochach na thân - redder than fire
5. You’ll notice a change of spelling in some adjectives when endings are added to them.
   - w > y
     - e.g. trwm (heavy) > cyn drymed â, yn drymach na, y tryma
6. Some consonants harden (d > t, g > c, b > p)
   - e.g. drud (expensive) > cyn ddruted â, yn ddrutach na, y druta
   - rhad (cheap) > cyn rhated â, yn rhatach na, y rhata
   - Also: gwlyb > gwlypach (wetter)
   - pwysig > pwysicach (more important)

### Adjectives which are too long to accommodate endings.

Most of them end in -ol, -og, -us or -gar, but not all.

| Language | Adjective   | Equative          | Comparative           | Superlative                                    |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| English  | interesting | as interesting as | more interesting than | the most interesting                           |
| Welsh    | diddorol    | mor ddiddorol â   | yn fwy diddorol na    | y mwya diddorol (m + pl) / y fwya diddorol (f) |
| English  | tasty       | as tasty as       | tastier than          | the tastiest                                   |
| Welsh    | blasus      | mor flasus â      | yn fwy blasus na      | y mwya blasus (m + pl)/y fwya blasus (f)       |

1. You’ll notice ‘long’ Welsh adjectives are not necessarily ‘long’ in English and vice versa
2. One or two adjectives will follow this pattern although they are short.
   - e.g. swil (shy) > mor swil â, yn fwy swil na, y mwya/fwya swil (m + pl)
   - Also: gwyllt (wild), diflas (miserable,boring), gwyntog (windy)

### Irregular adjectives

The following are the main irregular adjectives

| Language | Adjective      | Equative              | Comparative              | Superlative                       |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| English  | big/great/much | as big/great/much as  | bigger/greater/more than | the biggest/greatest/most         |
| Welsh    | mawr           | cymaint â             | yn fwy na                | y mwya (m + pl) / y fwya (f)      |
| English  | small          | as small as           | smaller than             | the smallest                      |
| Welsh    | bach           | cyn lleied â          | yn llai na               | y lleia (m + f + pl)              |
| English  | good           | as good as            | better than              | the best                          |
| Welsh    | da             | cystal â              | yn well na               | y gorau (m + pl) / yr orau (f)    |
| English  | bad            | as bad as             | worse than               | the worst                         |
| Welsh    | drwg           | cynddrwg/mor ddrwg â  | yn waeth na              | y gwaetha (m + pl) / y waetha (f) |
| English  | high           | as high as            | higher than              | the highest                       |
| Welsh    | uchel          | cyfuwch/mor uchel â   | yn uwch na               | yr ucha (m + f + pl)              |
| English  | low            | as low as             | lower than               | the lowest                        |
| Welsh    | isel           | cyn ised/mor isel â   | yn is na                 | yr isa (m + f + pl)               |
| English  | near           | as near as            | nearer than              | the nearest                       |
| Welsh    | agos           | cyn agosed/mor agos â | yn nes/agosach na        | yr agosa (m + f + pl)             |

Notice that we use ‘â’ and ‘na’ in front of words which begin with a consonant and ‘ag’ and ‘nag’ in front of words which begin with a vowel.

- e.g. cyn dewed â mochyn - as fat as a pig
- cyn dewed ag eliffant - as fat as an elephant
- yn fwy cymylog na ddoe - cloudier than yesterday
- yn fwy cymylog nag echdoe - cloudier than the day before yesterday

There is an Aspirate Mutation after both ‘â’ and ‘na’. See A.M. rules 8 and 9.

- e.g. mor fynyddig â Chymru - as mountainous as Wales
- yn dalach na choeden - taller than a tree

### Sentence order using superlatives

Sentences containing either the Comparative and Equative degree follow the normal sentence pattern, with the verb at the beginning of the sentence.

- e.g. Mae’r llyfrgell mor bell (cyn belled) â’r orsaf. - The library is as far as the station.
- Ydy tŷ Tom cymaint â thy Bill? - Is Tom’s house as big as Bill’s house?
- Roedd Tom yn dalach na Bill. - Tom is taller than Bill.
- Mae’r ferch yn dewach na’r bachgen. - The girl is fatter than the boy.

But when we use the Superlative degree of the adjective we must use the emphatic pattern - i.e. the verb doesn’t come at the beginning of the sentence.

- e.g. Efrog Newydd ydy’r pella. - New York is the farthest.
- Castell Windsor ydy’r mwya ym Mhrydain? - Ie/Ia - Windsor Castle is the largest in Britain? - Yes
- Muhammed Ali oedd y gorau. - Muhammed Ali was the best.

Note that the verb will always be in the third person singular:

- e.g. Fi ydy’r gorau. - I am the best.
- Chi ydy’r tala. - You are the tallest.
- Nhw ydy’r gwaetha. - They are the worst.
- Nhw oedd y gwaetha. - They were the worst.

In English we cannot use the Superlative degree when comparing only 2
things. We must use the Comparative degree.

- e.g. Tom and Paul. Tom is the taller. (not ‘tallest’)

This rule doesn’t apply in Welsh.

- e.g. Tom a Paul. Tom ydy’r tala.
