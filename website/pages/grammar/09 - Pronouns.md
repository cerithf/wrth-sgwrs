## F. Rhagenwau - Pronouns

### 1. Singular possessive pronouns (my/your/his/her)

The singular possessive pronouns cause mutations.

Sometimes a ‘confirming’ pronoun is used after the noun. This happens more often in the spoken language - but it can be omitted.

However, if the ‘possessor’ needs to be emphasized, it is this confirming pronoun which is stressed in Welsh.

- Dyma fy llyfr **i** a dyna dy lyfr **di** ar y bwrdd. - Here’s **my** book and there’s **your** book on the table.

#### (a) Nasal mutation after 'fy' (my)

‘Fy’ (my) is followed by an Nasal Mutation. See N.M. rule 2. The confirming pronoun for ‘fy’ is ‘i’.

- cath - fy nghath (i) - my cat
- pen - fy mhen (i) - my head
- trwyn - fy nhrwyn (i)- my nose
- gardd - fy ngardd (i) - my garden
- brawd - fy mrawd (i) - my brother
- desg - fy nesg (i) - my desk

c, p, t, g, b and d are the only letters that mutate. Other letters
remain unchanged.

- ffrind - fy ffrind (i) - my friend
- ysgol - fy ysgol (i) - my school
- llaw - fy llaw (i) - my hand

#### (b) Soft mutation after ‘dy’ (your) and ‘ei’(his)

‘Dy’ (your) and ‘ei’(his) cause a Soft Mutation. See S.M. rule 11.
The confirming pronoun for ‘dy’ is ‘di’. The confirming pronoun for ‘ei’(his) is ‘e ’in South Wales and ‘o’ in North Wales.

- cath - dy gath (di), ei gath (e/o) - your cat, his cat
- pen - dy ben (di), ei ben (e/o) - your head, his head
- trwyn - dy drwyn (di), ei drwyn (e/o) - your nose, his nose
- gardd - dy ardd (di), ei ardd (e/o) - your garden, his garden
- brawd - dy frawd (di), ei frawd (e/o) - your brother, his brother
- desg - dy ddesg (di), ei ddesg (e/o) - your desk, his desk
- llaw - dy law (di), ei law (e/o) - your hand, his hand
- rhosyn - dy rosyn (di), ei rosyn (e/o) - your rose, his rose
- mam - dy fam (di), ei fam (e / o) - your mother, his mother

c, p, t, g, b, d, ll, rh and m and are the only letters that mutate
Other letters remain unchanged.

- chwaer - dy chwaer (di) - your sister
- nith - ei nith (e/o) - his niece

#### (c) Aspirate mutation and invasive 'H' after 'ei' (her)

‘Ei’ (her) causes an Aspirate Mutation. See A.M. rule 4. The confirming pronoun for ‘ei’ is ‘hi’. This means the mutation can be the only way to tell the difference between 'his' and 'her' in Welsh.

- cath - ei chath (hi) - her cat
- pen - ei phen (hi) - her head
- trwyn - ei thrwyn (hi) - her nose

c, p, and t are the only letters that mutate. Other letters remain unchanged.

- brawd - ei brawd (hi) - her brother
- gwaith - ei gwaith (hi) - her work

If the word after 'ei' starts with a vowel, the "invasive H" is added before the vowel:

- enw - ei henw (hi) - her name
- acen - ei hacen (hi) - her accent
- ysgol – ei hysgol (hi) – her school
- wy – ei hwy (hi) – her egg

### 2. Plural pronouns (our/your/their)

The plural possessive pronouns ‘ein’ (our),’ eich’ (your) and ‘eu’ (their) do not cause mutations, but like ‘ei’ (her), **both ‘ein’ (our) and ‘eu’ (their) cause an invasive H** before a vowel.

The confirming pronoun for ‘ein’ (our) is ‘ni’, the confirming pronoun for ‘eich’ (your) is ‘chi’, and the confirming pronoun for ‘eu’ (their) is ‘nhw’.

- ysgol - ein hysgol (ni) - our school
- enw - eich enw (chi) - your name
- iaith - eu hiaith (nhw) - their language

### 3. Personal pronouns after long verbs

When a personal pronoun ( me / you / him / her / it / us / them) is used immediately after a ‘long’ verb (i.e. it is the object of that verb) then in Welsh we must also use the possessive pronouns ( see No. 1 above) in front of the verb-noun.

Remember that a ‘long’ verb is one made up of the verb ‘to be’ linked by ‘yn’ or ‘wedi’ to a verb-noun.

Examples:

- Fe / Mi fydda’ i’n **ei ffonio hi** heno. – I will be **telephoning her** tonight.
- Dyn ni ddim yn **eu nabod nhw**. – We don’t **know them**.
- Ydyn nhw wedi **eich ateb chi**? – Have they **answered you**?

The possessive pronouns will cause the verb-nouns to undergo the different mutations mentioned above. Remember that the word for 'it' depends on the gender of the noun ('e'/'o' for masculine nouns, 'hi' for feminine ones):

- Roedd hi’n ei ddarllen (e/o) ar y trên. – She was reading it (the book - masc.) on the train.
- Dw i ddim yn dy glywed di. – I can’t hear you.
- Ydy e'n/o’n ei charu hi?- Does he love her?
